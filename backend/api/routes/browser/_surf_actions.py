"""Legacy surf action endpoints — RETIRED (Wave 2.3 truth purge, issue #1240).

FIXED 2026-09-25 (audit M04 / WAVE_MASTER_PLAN §Wave 2.3):
This module previously shipped fabricated success responses while performing
no work — a hardcoded 1x1 transparent PNG for ``/surf/screenshot``, and
navigate/click/fill/click-at/type-key handlers that only appended a string to
an in-memory activity list and returned ``success: True`` without touching any
browser (Class-G false assurance: the system reporting success while doing no
work). ``/surf/accessibility`` returned a canned tree and
``/simulate-activity`` let callers inject fabricated activity entries.

Per the "real work or loud failure" doctrine (issue #445) and the
``_crown_jewel.py`` fix precedent, every endpoint here now fails loudly with
an explicit error that points callers to the REAL owner-scoped automation
stack in ``_automation.py`` (``/api/browser/automation/*``), which performs
actual Playwright-backed work via ``core.browser_session_manager``.

The request models are retained (re-exported by the package ``__init__`` for
backward compatibility); only the fabricated endpoint behaviour is retired.

Verified 2026-09-25: zero consumers of these paths exist in frontend/src,
apps/, packages/, shared/, or backend/tests (rg scan evidence on issue #1240).
