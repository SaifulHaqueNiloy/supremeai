"""Fail-closed gate for in-process execution of LLM-generated code (issue #704).

#704 (P2): ``backend/tools/ephemeral_synthesizer.py`` and
``backend/services/tool_forge.py`` execute LLM-generated Python via in-process
``exec()`` with a restricted ``__builtins__`` namespace. Restricted builtins are
NOT a security boundary (attribute-chain escapes are well known), so running
model-generated code inside the API process is a sandbox-escape / RCE risk.

Remediation strategy (issue #704 item 2): the in-process path is **fail-closed
by default**. All production/staging deployments refuse to exec unless the
explicit escape hatch ``SUPREMEAI_ALLOW_INPROCESS_CODEGEN`` is set to a truthy
value — intended for local development only. When the gate is off, call sites
return/raise their own structured error conventions and log a warning; nothing
is executed.

A real isolated runner exists in the repo (``backend/sandbox/docker_sandbox.py``,
``backend/tools/devops/docker_sandbox.py: DockerSandbox.run_secure`` — no
network, read-only FS, memory/CPU caps, hard timeout), but its API is
stdout/exit-code based and synchronous, so routing the return-value-oriented
async call sites through it cannot be done safely blind. Until that wiring
lands, this gate makes the in-process path opt-in.
