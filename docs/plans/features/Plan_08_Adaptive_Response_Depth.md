## Implementation Details

### Core Components
1. **Context Analyzer** (`src/main/java/com/supremeai/context/ContextAnalyzer.java`)
   - User interaction pattern analysis
   - Expertise level assessment
   - Conversation context tracking

2. **Response Depth Engine** (`src/main/java/com/supremeai/response/ResponseDepthEngine.java`)
   - Dynamic detail level adjustment
   - Content summarization/expansion
   - Response formatting optimization

3. **User Profile Manager** (`src/main/java/com/supremeai/profile/UserProfileManager.java`)
   - User preference storage
   - Expertise tracking
   - Interaction history analysis
