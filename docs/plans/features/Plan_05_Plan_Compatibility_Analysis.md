# Plan 5: Plan Compatibility & Blast-Radius Conflict Analysis
**Status:** 🔄 **EVOLVED / ACTIVE IN MCP DEPENDENCY & BLAST-RADIUS ENGINE**  
**Completion:** ~95% (MCP Dependency Graph + Rule Conflict Resolver)  
**Priority:** HIGH (P0 Systemic Coherence)  
**Last Updated:** September 2026  
**Domain Circle:** Circle C5 (Agent Orchestration) + Circle C4 (Safety & Policy)

## 🏛️ Architectural Evolution (Java Drools Rules ➔ MCP Dependency Graph & Blast-Radius Engine)
> [!NOTE]
> **Why this evolved from the May 2026 prototype:**
> - **Old Prototype (May 2026):** Relied on Java Drools rule files and static Firestore checks that could not detect real runtime service conflicts.
> - **Active Architecture (Sept 2026):** Powered by the **Central MCP Dependency Graph** (`system_dependencies`, `system_summary`) and the constitutional **Rule Precedence & Conflict Protocol** (`AGENTS.md` Section 5).
> - **Blast-Radius Mandate:** Ensures every architectural plan, capability update, or refactor automatically forecasts ripple effects across all upstream callers and downstream consumers before execution.

---

## 🎯 Architectural Intent & Overview
Systematic cross-plan validation engine that detects conflicting architectural requirements, missing environmental secrets, and circular dependencies. Enforces deterministic rule hierarchy when two operational policies compete.

---

## ⚙️ Active Implementation Details (Python & MCP Control Plane)

### 1. Central MCP Analysis Tools
- `system_dependencies` — Visualizes all active service connections, cross-circle links, and dependency status.
- `system_summary` & `system_health` — Verifies end-to-end platform reachability.
- `policy_preview` — Simulates execution conflicts and blast radius before deployment.
- **Location:** `infrastructure/mcp-control-plane/src/index.ts`

### 2. Backend Validation Engines
- **Pre-Merge Contract Validator:** `workflow-contract-report.json` & route drift checks.
- **Constitutional Conflict Resolver:** `AGENTS.md` Section 5 protocol (Safety ➔ Tenancy ➔ Mandatory Governance ➔ Project ➔ UX/Cost).
- **Backend Verification Suite:** `backend/verification/`

### 3. Key Active Features
- ✅ Automated dependency graph discovery across all 10 domain circles
- ✅ Upstream/downstream blast radius resolution
- ✅ Deterministic rule precedence resolution (pauses for HITL if irreconcilable)
- ✅ Zero-drift contract auditing between API models and frontend callers
