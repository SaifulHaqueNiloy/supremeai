# Plan 10: Dynamic API Limit Discovery & Rate-Limit Shield
**Status:** 🔄 **EVOLVED / ACTIVE IN REDIS RATE-LIMITER & MCP ADAPTERS**  
**Completion:** ~95% (Upstash Redis Throttling + Provider-Neutral Failover)  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Last Updated:** September 2026  
**Domain Circle:** Circle C2 (Cloud Infra) + Circle C1 (AI Providers)

## 🏛️ Architectural Evolution (Firestore Polling ➔ Redis Sliding-Window & MCP Quota Guard)
> [!NOTE]
> **Why this evolved from the May 2026 prototype:**
> - **Old Prototype (May 2026):** Polled Firestore periodically to count requests, causing high database read/write costs and delayed rate-limit reactions.
> - **Active Architecture (Sept 2026):** Powered by **Upstash Redis Sliding-Window Rate Limiting** (`redis_stats`, `redis_read_key`), combined with **MCP Provider Discovery & Health Sweeps** (`ai_available_providers`, `health_full_sweep`).
> - **Autonomous Degradation:** When an upstream provider (e.g. Groq or OpenAI) returns HTTP 429 (Rate Limit Exceeded), the gateway instantly downgrades to the next healthy provider without failing the user's task.

---

## 🎯 Architectural Intent & Overview
Real-time discovery, throttling, and auto-fallback engine protecting the platform against upstream API rate limits, TPM/RPM exhaustion, and unexpected billing spikes.

---

## ⚙️ Active Implementation Details (Python, Node & Redis)

### 1. Central MCP Health & Quota Tools
- `health_full_sweep` — Audits API reachability and latency across all connected providers.
- `ai_available_providers` — Queries real-time provider pool availability.
- `redis_stats` & `redis_ping` — Inspects live Redis rate-limiting state and sliding counters.
- **Location:** `infrastructure/mcp-control-plane/src/index.ts`

### 2. Backend Gateway & Rate Limiting Subsystems
- **Async Sliding-Window Throttler:** `backend/middleware/` & `backend/storage/` (Redis token bucket).
- **Graceful Fallback Router:** `backend/scaling/` & `backend/services/` (Provider-neutral fallback cascading: Primary ➔ Secondary ➔ Local LLM).

### 3. Key Active Features
- ✅ Zero 429 crashes; automated circuit breaker kicks in at 80% quota threshold
- ✅ Provider-neutral routing (seamlessly hops from Groq ➔ Gemini ➔ OpenRouter)
- ✅ Upstash Redis-backed sub-millisecond sliding rate limiting
- ✅ Redacted diagnostic telemetry for quota headers
