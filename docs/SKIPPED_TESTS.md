# Skipped Test and Contract Register

**Reviewed:** 2026-09-11
**Scope:** Repository test annotations and migration-dependent contracts
**Decision:** No integrations, environment variables, database migrations, or operational scripts are applied by this work item.

## Purpose

This file is the reviewable register for tests that are intentionally skipped or conditionally unavailable. A skipped test is not treated as evidence that a capability is healthy. Each entry must have an owner, a reason, and a next decision: restore, replace, or formally retire.

## Findings

The repository contains more skipped tests than the previously reported summary of six. The largest group is in `backend/tests/unit/test_api_endpoints.py`, where tests reference routes that were removed or moved during cleanup. There are also environment-dependent skips, including the Celery availability check.

The previous summary should therefore be treated as stale until a fresh inventory is generated in an environment with the project test tooling available.

## Current classifications

| Category | Evidence | Decision required |
|---|---|---|
| Removed or relocated API routes | `backend/tests/unit/test_api_endpoints.py` skips agent and conversation endpoints because the referenced routes are no longer present | Confirm replacement route contract, rewrite tests, or retire the obsolete tests |
| External-auth delegated behavior | The same test module skips duplicate-email, weak-password, and wrong-password cases because validation is delegated to Supabase | Keep as integration-contract tests only if the external auth system is available; otherwise document the boundary and add deterministic local contract tests |
| Optional worker dependency | `backend/tests/workers/test_celery_app.py` skips when Celery is unavailable | Keep conditional, but verify the worker test tier in CI where the dependency is installed |
| Previously reported strategic skips | Historical reports mention cognitive routing, generated gRPC protos, and task budget/rate limiting | Reconcile against the current tree before implementation; do not assume these remain the only skipped contracts |

## Acceptance rules

1. Every permanent skip must state why the behavior is unavailable and what replaces it.
2. A removed route must not retain tests for its old contract unless the tests are explicitly marked historical.
3. External-service behavior must have a deterministic boundary test that does not require credentials, plus an integration test in the appropriate environment when the behavior is production-critical.
4. Conditional dependency skips must be visible in CI summaries and must not silently reduce required coverage.
5. Strategic capabilities require an explicit owner and a decision record before implementation or retirement.

## Deferred actions

These actions are intentionally deferred because this session does not apply integrations, environment variables, database changes, or scripts:

- Run the complete skip inventory with the repository's canonical test command.
- Verify whether Supabase-backed auth and `ai_memory` prerequisites are available.
- Decide whether removed agent/conversation APIs should be restored, replaced, or retired.
- Implement or formally retire the generated-proto and task-budget contracts after current-tree verification.

### Cognitive-router decision record (2026-09-11)

The full v2.0 decomposition API remains deferred because the current implementation intentionally exposes only `CognitiveRouter.route()`. Rather than allowing the legacy v2.0 suite to stand as a false quality signal, deterministic tests now cover the supported direct, decomposed, budget-aware, and factory contracts in `backend/tests/test_strategic_patches/test_cognitive_router_contract.py`. The legacy v2.0 suite remains skipped until its missing public types and execution engine are implemented or formally retired.

Until the remaining actions are completed, skipped tests remain an explicit verification gap rather than a passing quality signal.

## Manual implementation handoff

The following items could not be safely implemented in this environment and are tracked with owners, blockers, manual steps, and acceptance conditions in `docs/MANUAL_IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md`:

- generated gRPC artifact restoration and worker-contract verification;
- task-budget/rate-limit contract discovery and implementation;
- complete current-tree skipped-test inventory.

This handoff is not a completion claim. Each item requires runtime evidence or a reviewed implementation diff before it is removed from the deferred register.
