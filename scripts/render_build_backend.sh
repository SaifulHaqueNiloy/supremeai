# SECURITY NOTE: an earlier revision uploaded the full poetry install logs to a
# public kvdb.io bucket (https://kvdb.io/9y62Spaye2gXXGUnvgebsa/log) to debug
# Render builds. Build logs can contain package URLs, internal hostnames and
# environment summaries, so that external upload channel has been removed.
# Logs now stay on the build machine only (Render keeps them visible in the
# dashboard), and the tail is echoed to stdout for quick triage.
