"""Regression guard: /api/v1/auth/refresh must be reachable (auth-middleware bypass).

Audit session (2026-08-30) found that ``POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`` was blocked
by the access-token auth middleware with 401 because the path was missing from
``SUPREMEAI_PUBLIC_PATHS``. The refresh endpoint authenticates via the
refresh-token JWT carried in the JSON body (``type=refresh`` enforced,
fail-closed inside the endpoint) — a Bearer *access* token is neither available
nor required by design. With the path gated, clients could never renew sessions
(token refresh was fully broken in production; previously misclassified as an
sqlite/JSONB env-specific test failure).

These tests lock the fix in:
  1. the default public-path config contains the refresh path;
  2. the middleware classifies the path as public (unit level);
  3. the refresh endpoint still fails closed without a valid refresh token
     (401/422) — making it public must NOT make it unauthenticated.
