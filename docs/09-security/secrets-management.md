## 🛡️ Security Guidelines

- **No Raw Password Storage:** Credentials must never be saved in plain text database fields or committed to git repositories.
- **External Secrets Manager:** All tokens, app passwords, and private keys must be stored in secure secrets managers (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GitHub Secrets, or encrypted local environment).
- **Token Rotation Policy:**
  - OAuth refresh tokens and app passwords must be rotated every **90 days**.
  - GitHub App keys and PATs should be audited and rotated annually or immediately upon suspected breach.
- **Governance & Approval Rules:**
  - AI is strictly prohibited from pushing changes directly to the `main` branch.
  - Changes must always flow through Pull Requests (PRs).
  - Explicit customer/admin approval is required before merging any AI-generated PR.
  - All automated commit actions must be logged for audit trails.
