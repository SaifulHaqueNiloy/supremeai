"""Coverage quality gate — evaluates coverage.json against tiered policy.

INTEGRITY FIX (final-test hardening-2, 2026-09-14):
The previous matcher compared policy globs like ``backend/core/llm/**``
against paths as they appear in coverage.json (``core/llm/...`` — relative
to the backend root, because pytest runs with ``--cov=core --cov=api ...``
inside ./backend). No path ever matched, both tiers accumulated ZERO files,
and the divide-by-zero guard reported a vacuous 100.00% "pass". The gate has
never enforced anything.

This version:
1. Normalises paths — every file is matched both bare and with the
   ``backend/`` prefix, and ``dir/**`` patterns match any depth below ``dir``.
2. Fails closed — a tier that matches ZERO files is a policy/coverage-scope
   drift (or a broken combine), not a perfect score.
3. Emits evidence — matched file/statement counts per tier plus the worst
   offenders (most missed lines), so CI logs show real numbers.
