"""Router mount hygiene — every registry router mounts EXACTLY once.

Background (2026-09-15 mount-dedup repair): PR #304/#305 shipped direct
``include_router`` blocks in ``core/app.py`` while PR #307 additionally
registered the same routers in the canonical ``ALL_ROUTERS`` registry — the app
ended up with 22 mission + 14 mcp-hub routes (each endpoint registered twice).
First-match wins at runtime so requests still worked, but OpenAPI listed
duplicates and the registry's mounted=N/N accounting no longer described the
app. This sentinel pins the invariant:

    1. the missions router contributes exactly 11 route registrations (one
       per @router decorator in the module — POST/GET on the same path are
       separate registrations, but a double-mount would make it 22);
    2. the mcp-hub router contributes exactly 7;
    3. NO (route path, method, endpoint) triple appears more than once on the
       app — any future double-mount of ANY router fails this test.

The duplicate-detection arc is the durable half: it does not hardcode counts,
so it keeps guarding every future router without maintenance.

    KNOWN EXCEPTIONS (both documented, both raised for owner decision):
    1. the ``api.routes.browser`` family: core/app_builder.py mounts it
       unconditionally ("route discovery must not depend on the optional
       safe-import registry") while ALL_ROUTERS also lists it — but with the
       scraper-route role filter skipping it on the ``core`` service role.
       Removing either mount today would change which service roles expose
       the browser surface.
    2. ``backend.*``-aliased module copies: the legacy import path can import
       the SAME files under the ``backend.`` namespace (order-dependent under
       import-mode=importlib), re-executing registration onto the singleton
       app with ``backend.api.routes...`` module names. The durable fix is
       conftest-level alias unification (sys.modules redirect), tracked as a
       next-round item with the full-suite verification it deserves.
    Every OTHER module is guarded — this guard already caught and fixed the
    api.routes.admin_routes, missions/mcp_hub, codeflow and vulnerability_prophet
    double mounts.
