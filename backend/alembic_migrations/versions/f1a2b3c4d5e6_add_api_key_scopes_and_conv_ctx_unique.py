"""add api_keys.scopes column and conversation_context session_id unique index

NOTE ON DRIFT: production's recorded alembic_version was found to be
"2026_08_19_043607", which does not exist anywhere in this migration chain.
This means `alembic upgrade head` cannot safely run against production until
a baseline-reconciliation migration is authored (see audit notes). The two
DDL changes below were verified against the live production schema
(project xtvkltzmberxekoamala) before being applied directly, and are
captured here only so the change is tracked in version control. Do NOT
run `alembic upgrade` against production with this file until the
baseline reconciliation migration exists and `alembic stamp` has been
run to align production's version pointer with this chain.
