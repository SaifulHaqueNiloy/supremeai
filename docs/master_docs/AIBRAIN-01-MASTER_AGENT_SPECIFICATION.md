# 09 — AI Brain & Agents

## Overview

The intelligence layer spans four cooperating areas of the backend: the **Brain** (`backend/brain/`) for model routing and cognition, the **LLM Gateway** (`backend/core/llm/`) for governed provider access, the **Agent framework** (`backend/agents/`, `backend/core/agents/`) for execution units, and **Memory & Learning** (`backend/memory/`, `backend/learning/`) for compounding experience.

## Brain (`backend/brain/`)

- **`model_router.py` — `ModelRouter`**: checks provider availability across gemini/openrouter/groq/deepseek/openai keys, picks the best provider using a latency tracker, and exposes monkeypatch hooks (`_call_openrouter`, `_call_huggingface`, `_call_ollama`) for tests.
- **`model_registry.py` — `ModelRegistry`**: tiered catalog from TIER 1 frontier models to free-tier options with OpenRouter IDs (e.g. `anthropic/claude-3-opus`, `openai/gpt-4o`, `deepseek/deepseek-chat`, `google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview`).
- **Cognition modules**: `cognitive_router.py`, `expert_router.py`, `gcp_router.py`, `parallel_cloud_router.py`, `performance_aware_router.py`, `reasoning_orchestrator.py`, `task_execution_engine.py`, `supreme_learning_engine.py`, `user_digital_twin.py`, `agent_departments.py`.

## LLM Gateway (`core/llm/llm_gateway.py`)

The single choke point for provider calls. Design properties:

- **litellm**, lazily imported (deferred to protect boot memory ~240 MB RSS).
- **Per-call API keys** — keys travel with the call, never injected into `os.environ`; `LLM_PROVIDER_KEYS` vault JSON supported; `_MODEL_KEY_MAP` covers groq/gemini/openai/deepseek/openrouter/hf/nvidia/moonshot/together/ollama.
- **Semantic cache** + **fallback chain** + shared **circuit-breaker** manager (reset via `/llm-gateway/admin/circuit-breaker/reset/{name}`).
- **`CostGuard`** enforces `MAX_COST_PER_TASK` and token budgets; orchestration halts fail-closed if the budget guardian dies.
- **Task-based dynamic routing** (`TASK_MODEL_MAP` & `AdvancedModelRouter`): 100% dynamic, driven by `core.config.settings` and Infisical Vault / environment variables (`MODEL_CODING`, `MODEL_REASONING`, `MODEL_VISION`, `MODEL_CHAT`, `MODEL_GENERAL`, `MODEL_MULTILINGUAL`, `EMBEDDING_MODEL`) with cost-optimized route ladders (`ROUTE_LADDER_SIMPLE`, `ROUTE_LADDER_MEDIUM`, `ROUTE_LADDER_COMPLEX`). Canonical reference: [`docs/architecture/hardcoded_to_dynamic_ai_model.md`](architecture/hardcoded_to_dynamic_ai_model.md).
- **Branding & Public Discovery**: `/api/config/public` and `/api/config/public/branding` expose dynamic model configs to frontend thin clients (`SUPREME_AVAILABLE_MODELS`, `modelBranding.ts`), completely preventing raw third-party vendor leaks.
- **Observability**: Langfuse adapter on calls; policy file `backend/config/routing_policy.json`; provider classes in `services/llm/providers.py` (`Provider` StrEnum: MOONSHOT, DEEPSEEK, TOGETHER, OLLAMA, GEMINI, HF_SPACE, OPENAI, GROQ) built on `BaseOpenAICompatibleProvider` with SSE parsing, `@circuit_breaker`, `@timed` metrics.
- **Free-tier rate limits**: `GEMINI_RPM_LIMIT=9`, `GROQ_RPM_LIMIT=28`, etc.
- **Ollama**: local-only adapter (`core/llm/providers/ollama_adapter.py`, default model `qwen2.5:0.5b`); `OLLAMA_URL` is fail-fast — no silent localhost fallback.

## Agent Framework

**Pydantic-AI integration** — `agents/base_pydantic_agent.py::BasePydanticAgent` wraps a pydantic-ai `Agent` (default `openai:gpt-4o`) wired to the gateway and `MCPRegistryClient`, with dynamic MCP tool registration.

**Frameworks inside `core/agents/framework/`:**
- `SupremeOrchestrator` (LangGraph-style, `langgraph_agent.py`)
- `SupremeCrew` / `CrewAgent` / `CrewTask` (CrewAI pattern, `crewai_agents.py`)
- `AgentDepartment` — `CodingAgent`, `ReviewAgent`, `QAAgent`
- `AutonomousAgent` (`task_runner_agent.py`)

**Declarative registry** — `core/agent_registry.json` defines agents (`guardian_expert`, `research_assistant`) with `system_prompt`, `tools[]`, `permissions[]`, `model_temp`, and resource constraints (`max_tokens_per_task`, `max_api_calls_per_hour`). `core/agent_factory.py` builds them; `core/agent_supervisor.py` supervises.

**Specialist agents** (`backend/agents/`): `SentinelAgent` (heartbeat monitor + anomaly detector + alert router), `InsightMage`, `VulnerabilityProphet`, `PerformanceGuardian`, `SkillLibrarian`/`SkillIngestor`/`SkillGarbageCollector`, `InternetMonitorAgent`, `MorphicAdapter`, `ephemeral_executor.py`, `headless_terminal_agent.py` — plus subpackages for domain, devops, governance, IDE, monitoring, infrastructure, evolution and SyncGuard.

**Live agents** (`core/agents/live/`): `benchmark_agent`, `vision_agent`, `browser_agent`, `computer_agent`.

## Orchestration (`core/orchestration/`)

`orchestrator.py::Orchestrator` runs a periodic `tick()` via `asyncio.TaskGroup`:

1. `_run_fitness_scoring` — `FitnessEngine` singleton scores skills
2. `SelfEvolutionAgent._tick` — self-evolution cycle
3. **Budget guardian subprocess** — `scripts/orchestrator/auto_budget_guardian.py`; failure halts the orchestrator (cost is fail-closed)

Task execution uses `decompose_intent()` → `execute_skill_chain()` over the `EvolutionSkillGraph` (edge-weight feedback, compensation fallbacks). HTTP surface: `GET /orchestrator/status`, `POST /orchestrator/tick` (Cloud Scheduler target). Siblings: `agent_orchestrator.py`, `master_cognitive_orchestrator.py` (CLI: `tools/master_orchestrator.py --intent repair|synthesis|audit|evolution`), `swarm_orchestrator.py`, `trio_pipeline.py` (Gemini → Kilo → Cline), `crew_departments.py`, `cloud_sandbox_orchestrator.py`.

## Tool Library (`backend/tools/` — 123 files)

`code/`, `media/`, `mcp/`, `browser/`, `devops/`, `knowledge/`, `learning/`, `social/`, `security_tools/`, `localization/`, `billing/`, `analytics/`, `creative/`, `ai_agents/`. Tools are composed by the skill chain, not hard-wired to agents.

## MCP Integration

- **Official server**: `tools/mcp/mcp_server.py` ("supremeai-knowledge-graph", stdio) exposing `get_skill_dependencies` and `find_optimal_learning_path` over Neo4j.
- **Sibling servers**: `mcp_supabase.py`, `mcp_workspace.py`, `mcp_cloud_deploy.py`, `mcp_github_cicd.py`, `mcp_observability.py`, `mcp_ide_trio.py`, `memory/mcp_server.py`.
- **Clients**: `core/mcp_client.py` (`MCPRegistryClient`, `ControlTowerClient`), `brain/mcp_client.py`.
- **Security**: `core/mcp_allowlist.py`, `core/plugins/mcp_security.py`.
- **Control Tower**: `infrastructure/mcp-control-plane/` — TypeScript MCP server deployed as `supremeai-mcp-tower` with adapters for render, firebase, supabase, redis, infisical, cloudflare, github/actions and an AI key pool.

## Memory & Learning

**Memory stack** (`backend/memory/`): `unified_db_manager.py` (single entry point, `write_via_unified_memory()` consumed by tools), `episodic_memory.py`, `long_term_memory.py`, `chromadb_store.py`, `supabase_store.py` (pgvector), `rag_pipeline.py`, `sliding_window.py`. Vector writes use `core/embeddings.embed_for_pgvector()` (dim 1536) into the `ai_memory` table.

**Learning loop** (`backend/learning/`): `experience.py` (task→experience records), `pattern_recognizer.py`, `hypothesis_engine.py`, `outcome_analyzer.py`, `evolution_bridge.py`. Outcomes feed the evolution engine (`backend/evolution/`: `advanced_evolution_engine.py`, `fitness_evaluator.py`, `canary_manager.py`, `benchmark_runner.py`).

**Knowledge tools** (repo-level): `tools/knowledge/` injects Tool Knowledge Cards (categories RADAR/SHIELD/ENGINE/ORCHESTRATOR/MEMORY/EVOLUTION) into `ai_memory` with content-hash dedup; `tools/knowledge_squeezer/` runs multi-model brainstorm → adversarial audit → Socratic gap mining → confidence-gated synthesis → optional long-term memory promotion.

## Reasoning Engines (`backend/engine/`)

`smart_router.py`, `tree_of_thought.py`, `debate_engine.py`, `self_reflection.py`, `vector_db.py`, `worker_node.py`, and `compression/token_juice.py` (token-compression pass, toggled by `TOKEN_JUICE_ENABLED`). The `ecosystem/` package hosts the phase 2–14 orchestration modules (task engine, capability registry, governance, approval workflow) on a shared SQLite store for fast local operation.

## Optional External Integrations

`backend/integrations/` — each flag-gated *and* guarded by `importlib.util.find_spec`, zero-cost fallback when absent: **mem0** (`SUPREMEAI_MEM0_ENABLED`), **Graphiti** (`SUPREMEAI_GRAPHITI_ENABLED`), **browser-use** (`SUPREMEAI_BROWSER_USE_ENABLED`), **E2B** (`SUPREMEAI_E2B_ENABLED`), **OpenHands** (`SUPREMEAI_OPENHANDS_ENABLED`).

## 🎯 360° Feature Gap & Implementation Feasibility Matrix (Consolidated)

Based on in-depth repository capability audits across backend (`FastAPI`, `LiteLLM`, `RAG`, `WebContainer`, `Celery`), frontend (`React 19`, `Zustand`, `Tailwind 4`), and competitor intelligence (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek):

### 🟢 Tier S — High Impact, Immediate Feasibility ($0 Infra Cost Fit)
| # | Feature | Architectural Fit & Backend Capability | Implementation Path |
|---|---|---|---|
| **S1** | **Public Share Links** | Backend chat persistence exists; requires public read-only route | Public `/share/[id]` route + backend `/api/share/{id}` + TTL cache (Strict Tenant Isolation enforced) |
| **S2** | **Reasoning / Thinking Display** | `tree_of_thought.py`, `debate_engine.py`, and `reasoning_orchestrator.py` active | Frontend collapsible "💭 Thinking..." panel reading SSE event metadata |
| **S3** | **Artifacts Panel** | WebContainer already runs Node.js client-side | Message `artifact` type rendering into an isolated WebContainer/iframe sandboxed preview |
| **S4** | **Image Upload to Chat** | Vision-capable models (`gpt-4o`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, `claude-3-5-sonnet`) & `vision_service.py` active | File input + Supabase Storage upload with frontend compression & size limits |
| **S5** | **Slash Commands** (`/research`, `/code`, `/image`) | `commandRegistry.ts` active | Chat input dropdown trigger on `/` |
| **S6** | **Search Across Chats** | `chatStore` & backend chat API active | `/api/chat/search?q=` endpoint + Command palette integration |
| **S7** | **Export (PDF / Markdown / Docx)** | Chat message state ready | Client-side export via `jsPDF` / markdown formatter |
| **S8** | **Global User Memory** | `memory_service.py` and `ai_memory` (pgvector) active | Profile Memory dashboard + scoped retrieval |
| **S9** | **Prompt Template Library** | Skills catalog pattern reuse | Reusable prompt template library table + prompt drawer |
| **S10** | **Branch Conversations** | `chatStore` tree structuring | Child message branching (`parent_id` hierarchy) |
| **S11** | **Scheduled Background Tasks** | Celery / RQ worker queue | Cloudflare Cron / Pinger trigger to wake background tasks |
| **S12** | **Deep Research Mode** | `autonomous_browser.py` + `rag_pipeline.py` + web search | 10-step autonomous research orchestration report generator |

### 🟡 Tier A — Moderate Effort / Specialized Integration
- **A1. Custom Agent Builder (Gems / Custom GPTs):** Skill manifest visual builder reusing the Skills Marketplace UI.

### 2.2 Key Architectural Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Fail-Fast Configuration (`backend/core/config.py`)
```python
# Startup crashes if any critical env var is missing
try:
    settings = Settings()
except Exception as _boot_exc:
    logger.critical(f"🔥 FATAL CONFIG ERROR: {_boot_exc}")
    sys.exit(1)
```
**Assessment:** ✅ Excellent — prevents silent failures in production

#### Pattern 2: Thin Client Architecture (`tools/vscode-extension/`)
The VS Code extension contains **zero API keys** and communicates solely through `SupremeAIService.ts` → Backend endpoint.
**Assessment:** ✅ Secure by design — brand exclusivity enforced

#### Pattern 3: Provider-Agnostic LLM Gateway (`backend/brain/smart_router.py`)
Uses LiteLLM for unified access to 8+ LLM providers with automatic fallback chains.
**Assessment:** ✅ Resilient — zero-cost fallback active

#### Pattern 4: Self-Healing Memory System
Post-fix bug patterns are injected into:
- `ai_memory` table (pgvector embeddings)
- `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` (human-readable)
**Assessment:** 🟡 Innovative but adds complexity

---

## 3. Issues Found

### 3.1 🔴 Critical Issues (P0)

#### Issue 3.1.1: Production Environment Missing 90+ Keys
**File:** `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `render.yaml`  
**Status:** OPEN

The Render backend deployment (`supremeai-backend-docker`) is missing approximately **90 environment variables**, including:
- `SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL` — Database connection
- `STRIPE_API_KEY` / `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — Payments
- `REDIS_URL` — Caching layer
- `QDRANT_*` — Vector database
- All LLM API keys except basic ones

**Impact:** Production features degraded despite CI passing.

**Recommendation:**
```bash
# Run env sync script to push all required keys
python scripts/push_all_render_envs.py
# Then verify with live API check
python scripts/verify_render_envs.py --service-id srv-da07ogmgekts739amqa0
```

---

#### Issue 3.1.2: Infisical Universal Auth Failing (401)
**File:** `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`  
**Status:** OPEN

Machine Identity credentials (`INFISICAL_CLIENT_ID`/`INFISICAL_CLIENT_SECRET`) were rotated but **never registered in Infisical dashboard**, causing 401 errors on every vault access attempt.

**Current Workaround:** Falls back to `INFISICAL_TOKEN` direct auth (less secure).

**Recommendation:**
1. Log into Infisical console
2. Create new Machine Identity under project
3. Update `INFISICAL_CLIENT_ID` and `INFISICAL_CLIENT_SECRET` in all environments
4. Verify with `python scripts/verify_infisical_env.py`

---

#### Issue 3.1.3: Secrets Rotation Incomplete
**File:** `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`  
**Status:** OPEN - MANUAL_REQUIRED

Multiple credential sets require manual rotation:
- [ ] Render API keys
- [ ] GitHub PATs
- [ ] Supabase database credentials
- [ ] All LLM provider API keys

**Location of rotation artifacts:** `f:\_supremeai_secrets_backup\rotated_secrets.json`

---

### 3.2 🟠 High Priority Issues (P1)

#### Issue 3.2.1: SSRF Vulnerability in Scraper (PARTIALLY FIXED)
**File:** `backend/services/scraper/main.py`  
**Status:** Fixed for `/recipe`, verify others

The `/recipe` endpoint was accepting user-supplied URLs without validation, allowing **Server-Side Request Forgery** attacks against internal metadata services.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Added is_safe_url() check before page.goto()
if not is_safe_url(initial_url):
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="URL not allowed")
```

**Remaining Risk:** Verify same protection exists for `/scrape` and `/browse` endpoints.

---

#### Issue 3.2.2: Exposed API Routes Without Authentication
**File:** `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` (2026-08-22 entry)  
**Status:** Recently Fixed

Multiple route handlers lacked authentication dependencies:
- `server.py` — Core endpoints
- `chat.py` — Chat streaming
- `browser.py` — Browser automation
- `byoc_api.py` — BYOC endpoints

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Added auth dependency to routers
router = APIRouter(dependencies=[Depends(get_current_user_token)])
```

**Verification Needed:** Audit all route registrations for consistent auth.

---

#### Issue 3.2.3: Telemetry Masking Real Errors
**File:** `backend/core/llm/telemetry.py`  
**Status:** Fixed

The `to_log_line()` function would crash on non-JSON objects, and the `finally` block masked actual LLM results with generic "ALL_MODELS_FAILED" message.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
json.dumps(..., default=str)  # Safe serialization
with contextlib.suppress(Exception):  # Best-effort logging
```

---

### 3.3 🟡 Medium Priority Issues (P2)

#### Issue 3.3.1: React Race Condition in DashboardShell
**File:** `frontend/src/components/DashboardShell.tsx`  
**Status:** Fixed

AI response timer using `setTimeout` suffered from stale closure when users rapidly switched sessions.

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// useRef to track latest session ID
const activeSessionId = useRef<string>(sessionId);
useEffect(() => {
  return () => { clearTimeout(timerRef.current); }; // Cleanup
}, [sessionId]);
```

---

#### Issue 3.3.2: Hardcoded Backend URLs in Client Code
**File:** `frontend/src/shared/supremeShared.ts`  
**Status:** Fixed

Legacy hardcoded URLs caused drift when backend deployment changed.

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Before: const BACKEND_URL = "https://old-url.onrender.com"
// After:
const BACKEND_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_URL || "https://fallback.onrender.com";
```

---

#### Issue 3.3.3: Chaos Worker Fail-Open Policy
**File:** `backend/workers/chaos_worker.py`  
**Status:** Fixed

When `fuzz_sandbox` was unavailable, chaos worker silently skipped gate unlock (fail-open).

**Fix Applied:**
```python
if fuzz_sandbox_available:
    await run_fuzz_test()
else:
    raise SecurityAuditError("Sandbox unavailable — blocking deploy")  # fail-closed
```

---

#### Issue 3.3.4: YAML Indentation Bug in CI Pipeline
**File:** `.github/workflows/maintenance_pipeline.yml`  
**Status:** Fixed

11-space indentation instead of 6-space caused silent YAML parse failure in cost-guard-defcon job.

**Lesson:** Always validate YAML with `yaml.safe_load()` before committing CI changes.

---

### 3.4 🔵 Low Priority / Technical Debt (P3)

| Issue | Location | Impact |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Dead code in scraper `main.py` (duplicate `_APP_IMPORT_STRING`) | `scraper/main.py` | Maintenance confusion |
| Variable `index` outside loop scope in `execute_recipe` | `browser_agent.py` | Potential NameError |
| Missing imports in `admin_dashboard.py`, `traffic_monitor.py` | Multiple files | Runtime NameError |
| Missing `complexity` key after smart_router consolidation | `brain/smart_router.py` | Downstream consumer failure |
| 4 tests → 37 tests gap (scraper) | `tests/scraper/` | Coverage was 10%, now ~86% |
| Pydantic model missing default for `steps` field | `RecipeRequest` | HTTP 422 on empty POST |

---

## 5. Cost Analysis

### 5.1 Current Cost Structure (Excellent — Near Zero)

| Component | Provider | Current Cost | Optimization Potential |
|-----------|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Backend Hosting** | Render (Free Tier) | $0/mo | At scale: ~$7-50/mo |
| **Frontend Hosting** | Render Static | $0/mo | Negligible |
| **Scraper Service** | Render (Free Tier) | $0/mo | Consider serverless |
| **Database** | Supabase Free | $0/mo | ~$25/mo at 500MB |
| **Redis Cache** | Upstash Free | $0/mo | ~$5/mo at scale |
| **Secrets Vault** | Infisical Free | $0/mo | ~$20/mo for team |
| **Monitoring** | Sentry (Free) | $0/mo | ~$29/mo at volume |
| **LLM API Calls** | Various | Pay-per-use | See below |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | Free (public repo) | $0 if stays public |
| **Domain/SSL** | Render provided | $0 | N/A |

**Estimated Monthly Minimum:** **$0** (free-tier optimized)  
**Estimated Monthly at Scale (1000 users):** **$200-500/mo**

### 5.2 LLM Cost Optimization Opportunities

#### Current Architecture
```
User Request → Smart Router → Provider Selection → LLM Call → Response
                                    ↓
                          Fallback Chain (if primary fails)
```

**Identified Optimizations:**

1. **TokenJuice Context Compression Engine** (`backend/engine/compression/token_juice.py`)
   - Already implemented
   - Reduces context window size before LLM calls
   - **Savings Estimate:** 30-40% reduction in input tokens

2. **Hierarchical Memory Tree** (`backend/memory/hierarchical_tree.py`)
   - Reduces redundant memory lookups
   - Vector similarity search before full retrieval
   - **Savings Estimate:** 20% reduction in embedding API calls

3. **Provider Fallback Chain Optimization**
   - Current: Gemini → Groq → OpenRouter → Ollama (local)
   - Recommend: Add caching layer for identical queries
   - **Savings Estimate:** 15-25% on repeated queries

4. **Streaming SSE Responses** (`POST /api/chat/stream`)
   - Already implemented — reduces latency perception
   - Enables early termination if user aborts

### 5.3 Infrastructure Cost Reduction Recommendations

| Strategy | Implementation Effort | Estimated Savings |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Response Caching** (Redis) | Low | 20-30% LLM costs |
| **Query Deduplication** | Medium | 10-15% LLM costs |
| **Batch Embedding** (nightly) | Medium | 40% embedding costs |
| **Local Ollama Fallback** | Already implemented | $0 for local inference |
| **Idle Sleep Mode** (Render) | Low | Prevents free-tier exhaustion |
| **CDN for Static Assets** | Low | Faster loads, less bandwidth |

## 7. SuperAI Roadmap: Strategic Recommendations

### 7.1 Immediate Actions (Week 1)

#### Priority 1: Fix Production Environment
```bash
# 1. Sync all environment variables to Render
python scripts/push_all_render_envs.py --verify

# 2. Fix Infisical Machine Identity
# Log into https://app.infisical.com
# Create new Machine Identity under project settings
# Update INFISICAL_CLIENT_ID and INFISICAL_CLIENT_SECRET

# 3. Verify system health
python scripts/health/check_system_health.py
```

#### Priority 2: Complete Security Hardening
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware (Redis-backed)
- [ ] Enable automated dependency scanning (Dependabot/Renovate)
- [ ] Implement API key rotation policy (90-day max age)
- [ ] Add request/response logging for audit trail

#### Priority 3: Stabilize CI Pipeline
- [ ] Pin all GitHub Actions to SHA hashes (not tags)
- [ ] Unify coverage thresholds across modules
- [ ] Add integration test suite for critical paths

---

### 7.2 Short-Term Improvements (Month 1)

#### A. Reduce Maintenance Burden

**Problem:** 70+ Python dependencies, complex configuration

**Solution:**
```toml
# pyproject.toml - Create optional groups
[tool.poetry.group.ai]
optional = true  # Only install when AI features needed

[tool.poetry.group.analytics] 
optional = true  # Only install when telemetry needed
```

**Expected Outcome:** 30% reduction in base image size, faster CI installs

#### B. Implement Query Caching Layer

```python
# backend/core/cache.py (new file)
from redis import asyncio as aioredis

class QueryCache:
    """Cache identical LLM queries for 24h"""
    TTL = 86400  # 24 hours
    
    async def get_or_compute(self, query_hash: str, compute_fn):
        cached = await redis.get(f"llm:{query_hash}")
        if cached:
            return json.loads(cached)
        result = await compute_fn()
        await redis.setex(f"llm:{query_hash}", self.TTL, json.dumps(result))
        return result
```

**Expected Outcome:** 20-30% reduction in LLM API costs

#### C. Add Health Dashboard

Create lightweight `/admin/health` page showing:
- All service statuses (database, redis, llm providers)
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates by endpoint
- Cache hit/miss ratios

---

### 7.3 Medium-Term Vision (Quarter 1)

#### Transform to True "SuperAI"

**Phase A: Autonomous Self-Healing**
```
Current: Human detects issue → Human diagnoses → Human fixes → Human deploys
Target:  System detects → AI diagnoses → AI proposes → Human approves → Auto-deploy
```

Implementation:
1. Enhance `AutoHealerService` to automatically create PRs for detected issues
2. Integrate with GitHub API for automated fix proposals
3. Add human-in-the-loop approval workflow

**Phase B: Cost-Autonomous Operations**
```
Current: Manual cost monitoring → Manual optimization decisions
Target:  Real-time cost tracking → Automatic scaling decisions → Budget alerts
```

Implementation:
1. Build cost attribution dashboard (per-user, per-feature)
2. Implement auto-scaling rules based on queue depth
3. Set budget thresholds with auto-disable for expensive features

**Phase C: Multi-Agent Swarm Intelligence**
```
Current: Single AI assistant responding to user requests
Target:  Specialized agent swarm collaborating on complex tasks
```

Already partially implemented:
- `AdvancedReasoningEngine` (5 reasoning types)
- `EvolutionModule` (Genetic Algorithm optimization)
- `LivingEngineOrchestrator` (13/13 tests passing)

Next steps:
1. Define agent specialization boundaries
2. Implement inter-agent communication protocol
3. Add swarm coordination layer

---

### 7.4 Innovation Opportunities

#### 1. Edge Computing Integration
Move LLM inference closer to users:
- Cloudflare Workers AI for simple tasks
- Vercel AI Gateway for edge routing
- Keep complex reasoning on central backend

**Cost Impact:** Reduce latency by 40-60%, lower bandwidth costs

#### 2. Federated Learning Architecture
Allow model personalization without centralizing user data:
- On-device fine-tuning (VS Code extension)
- Federated aggregation of improvements
- Privacy-preserving updates

**Strategic Value:** Competitive differentiation, privacy compliance

#### 3. Community Contribution Layer
Open-source the "Eternal Brain" memory system:
- Allow community to contribute learned patterns
- Curated knowledge marketplace
- Reputation system for contributors

**Monetization Potential:** Enterprise curated knowledge packs

---

## 8. Final Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Excellent Zero-Cost Architecture** — Masterful use of free tiers across stack
2. **Comprehensive Documentation** — Best-in-class project documentation practices
3. **Security-Conscious Design** — Thin client pattern, fail-fast config, gitleaks
4. **Self-Healing Ambition** — AutoHealer, memory injection, lessons learned system
5. **Modern Tech Stack** — FastAPI, React 19, Vite 7, Pydantic V2

### Weaknesses
1. **Production Configuration Drift** — 90+ missing env vars indicates deployment gaps
2. **Secrets Management Fragility** — Infisical 401, incomplete rotations
3. **High Dependency Count** — 70+ Python packages increases vulnerability surface
4. **Complexity vs. Team Size** — Ambitious architecture may outpace maintenance capacity

### Overall Verdict

**SupremeAI is a well-archituted, ambitiously-scoped AI platform** that has made excellent progress toward its vision of self-learning autonomy. The recent simplification from microservices to unified monorepo was the right decision for a project at this stage.

**To reach "SuperAI" status at lowest cost:**
1. **Immediate:** Fix production environment (1-2 days effort)
2. **Short-term:** Add caching and reduce dependencies (2-4 weeks)
3. **Medium-term:** Implement autonomous healing and cost optimization (1-3 months)

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM — Production has gaps but architecture is sound  
**Recommendation:** PROCEED with caution — address P0 issues before user acquisition

# SupremeAI Engineering Intelligence Decision Log

This log records policy decisions, accepted risks, false positives, false negatives, and rule changes for the engineering-intelligence system. It is append-only in spirit: correct an entry with a new decision rather than rewriting history.

## Entry format

- **ID:** `POL-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN`
- **Date:** ISO-8601 date
- **Scope:** detector, CI, deployment, repository index, planner, repair, or autonomy
- **Decision:** what was decided
- **Evidence:** reports, tests, commit SHA, or source locations
- **Risk/impact:** known consequence
- **Owner:** accountable reviewer
- **Status:** proposed, accepted, rejected, superseded

## Decisions

### POL-2026-09-07-001

- **Date:** 2026-09-07
- **Scope:** policy baseline
- **Decision:** Use four risk levels: `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `critical`. Unknown risk cannot be labeled low.
- **Evidence:** `docs/ai-engineering/INTELLIGENCE_POLICY.md`; roadmap Phase 0
- **Risk/impact:** Conservative classifications may create review overhead until measured.
- **Owner:** SupremeAI engineering
- **Status:** accepted

### POL-2026-09-07-002

- **Date:** 2026-09-07
- **Scope:** protected surfaces
- **Decision:** Treat CI, deployment, migrations, secrets, authentication, tenant isolation, billing, and production configuration as protected by default.
- **Evidence:** `scripts/ai/change_impact_detector.py`; policy protected-path section
- **Risk/impact:** Protected changes require explicit review and cannot be silently automated.
- **Owner:** SupremeAI engineering
- **Status:** accepted

### POL-2026-09-07-003

- **Date:** 2026-09-07
- **Scope:** automation boundary
- **Decision:** Deterministic tools own gate status; AI may plan and explain but cannot mark its own evidence as verified.
- **Evidence:** roadmap Sections 2, 3, and 5
- **Risk/impact:** Model failures degrade planning quality, not safety-gate integrity.
- **Owner:** SupremeAI engineering
- **Status:** accepted

### POL-2026-09-07-004

- **Date:** 2026-09-07
- **Scope:** enforcement rollout
- **Decision:** Keep the current intelligence checks advisory until fixture coverage, reproducibility, false-positive review, and rollback evidence justify blocking mode.
- **Evidence:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; roadmap Phase 3
- **Risk/impact:** A defect may be reported without immediately blocking a merge during the measurement period.
- **Owner:** SupremeAI engineering
- **Status:** accepted

## False-positive and false-negative review template

When a finding is disputed, append a new entry containing:

- the exact command and commit SHA;
- the finding category and report excerpt without secret values;
- why it was a false positive or false negative;
- the proposed rule/test change;
- regression-fixture coverage;
- reviewer and final disposition.

<!-- ============================================================ -->

# SupremeAI Engineering Intelligence Policy

**Status:** Active baseline policy
**Version:** 1.0
**Owner:** SupremeAI engineering
**Related:** `SUPREMEAI_ENGINEERING_INTELLIGENCE_ROADMAP.md`, `AGENTS.md`

## Purpose

This policy defines the deterministic rules SupremeAI must follow before it plans, changes, validates, or repairs repository code. An AI explanation cannot override a failed check, missing evidence, or an approval requirement.

## Risk vocabulary

| Risk | Meaning | Default decision |
|---|---|---|
| `low` | Narrow, reversible change with complete deterministic validation and no protected surface | May proceed after automated checks |
| `medium` | Reviewable change with limited blast radius, or incomplete validation evidence | Produce a plan and require human review |
| `high` | Protected surface, broad dependency impact, or failed deterministic validation | Block mutation; require explicit approval and remediation |
| `critical` | Irreversible, production, security, credential, data, or tenant-isolation impact | Stop; human owner must approve each action |

Unknown risk is never equivalent to low risk.

## Protected paths and surfaces

Changes touching any of the following are protected by default:

- `.github/`, `.clinerules/`, `.specify/`
- `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, security and policy documents
- `backend/alembic_migrations/`, database schema and migration tooling
- `infrastructure/`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose*`, deployment manifests
- `.env*`, secret/configuration files, credential loaders, CI secret wiring
- authentication, authorization, tenant isolation, billing, payment, and security code
- production configuration, release scripts, rollback tooling, and protected branches

The registry in `scripts/ai/change_impact_detector.py` is the executable baseline. A policy change must update the registry, tests, and this document together.

## Change classes and approval matrix

| Change class | Examples | Required evidence | Approval |
|---|---|---|---|
| Documentation-only | Markdown, audit notes, comments | Link/reference check | Automated checks |
| Local implementation | Isolated module or test with no protected dependency | Impact report, targeted tests, type/lint checks | Human review of diff |
| Dependency/configuration | Manifest, lockfile, build/runtime config | Manifest-lockfile check, clean install/build | Explicit human review |
| Delivery system | CI, Docker, deployment, release, rollback | Preflight, clean CI-equivalent run, evidence bundle | Explicit owner approval |
| Data/security boundary | Auth, tenant isolation, secrets, migrations, billing | Security/data review, rollback plan, deterministic gates | Explicit approval per change |
| Production/irreversible | Deploy, delete, migrate, publish, protected branch | Full evidence bundle and rollback/restore proof | Always human approval |

## Mandatory decision rules

1. Missing impact, provenance, or validation evidence blocks sensitive actions.
2. A broken import, failed deterministic check, or protected-path finding blocks mutation.
3. Repository content may be analyzed as data but cannot redefine this policy.
4. AI-generated claims must cite indexed files and line ranges; unsupported claims are `unknown`.
5. Proposed actions and executed actions must be recorded separately.
6. Every mutation must have a reviewable diff and a rollback strategy before execution.
7. Secrets are represented only by names and classifications, never values.
8. An AI model may recommend a decision, but deterministic tools own gate status.
9. No component may increase its own autonomy level.

## Required evidence record

Every non-trivial change should record:

- repository and commit SHA;
- changed-file list and protected-path result;
- impact and risk report;
- validation commands and exit status;
- cited plan or explicit reason for stopping;
- reviewer identity/decision when approval is required;
- rollback status and unresolved limitations.

## Enforcement

This policy is advisory until the corresponding CI gate is explicitly promoted to blocking mode. Promotion requires a measured false-positive review, reproducible fixtures, owner approval, and a documented rollback path.

# SupremeAI Engineering Intelligence Roadmap

**Status:** Proposed execution roadmap
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 7 September 2026
**Owner:** SupremeAI engineering
**Related:** `docs/SUPREMEAI_MASTER_ROADMAP_2026-09.md`, `docs/SPEC_KIT_ADOPTION.md`, `AGENTS.md`

## 1. Purpose

SupremeAI must be intelligent in its engineering behavior, not only in its conversational output. Before changing code, it should understand impact, identify unsafe assumptions, select the smallest safe change, verify the result with real evidence, and stop when confidence is insufficient.

This roadmap builds that capability incrementally. It does **not** authorize unrestricted self-modification, autonomous production deployment, secret access, or AI-only validation.

## 2. Intelligence Contract

For every non-trivial change, SupremeAI should produce:

1. **Intent** — what outcome is requested and what is explicitly out of scope.
2. **Impact map** — affected files, imports, routes, packages, tests, CI jobs, deployment assets, environment variables, and documentation.
3. **Risk assessment** — import, runtime, data, security, CI, deployment, cost, and rollback risk.
4. **Safe plan** — ordered changes, validation commands, approval points, and rollback path.
5. **Evidence bundle** — diff, checks, test output, build output, warnings, and unresolved limitations.
6. **Decision** — proceed, ask for approval, or stop with a precise reason.

The system may explain evidence, but it must never replace evidence with confidence language.

## 3. Governing Principles

- **Evidence over intuition:** compiler, tests, static analysis, and deployment checks are the truth layer.
- **Smallest safe change:** prefer reversible, narrow changes over broad restructuring.
- **Fail closed:** missing authorization, provenance, validation, or required configuration blocks sensitive actions.
- **Human control:** destructive, external, privileged, financial, credential, migration, and production actions require explicit approval.
- **No hidden mutation:** every file, schema, dependency, configuration, and deployment change must be visible in a reviewable diff.
- **Deterministic core:** risk rules, policy checks, path validation, and gates must be deterministic; AI adds planning and explanation.
- **No fake intelligence:** a mocked result, status-only adapter, hardcoded success, or silent exception is not an implementation.
- **Rollback first:** every automated mutation needs a restore strategy before execution.
- **Tenant and secret safety:** never infer identity from client input and never expose secrets to models, clients, logs, or artifacts.
- **Progressive autonomy:** autonomy increases only after measured reliability, not after a successful demo.

## 4. Target Architecture

```text
Request / PR / agent task
        |
        v
Intent + scope parser
        |
        v
Repository intelligence index
  (files, symbols, imports, routes, workflows, packages, env names)
        |
        v
Impact analyzer + policy engine
        |
        +--> low risk: propose and validate
        +--> medium risk: propose, validate, request review
        +--> high/critical: stop and require explicit approval
        |
        v
Change executor (sandboxed, reversible)
        |
        v
Deterministic validation gates
        |
        v
Evidence bundle + risk decision + audit event
```

The repository index is an acceleration layer, never the sole authorization source. Runtime identity, tenant ownership, permissions, and deployment controls remain authoritative in their existing systems.

## 5. Delivery Phases

### Phase 0 — Baseline and policy (P0)

**Goal:** define what intelligence means and prevent unsafe automation.

Deliverables:

- [x] Create a change-risk vocabulary: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`.
- [x] Define protected paths: auth, migrations, secrets, deployment, CI, billing, tenant isolation, and production configuration.
- [x] Define change classes and approval requirements.
- [x] Define a standard impact report and evidence bundle schema.
- [x] Record baseline commands for backend, frontend, CI, packaging, and deployment checks in `scripts/ai/baseline_commands.json`.
- [x] Add a decision log for false positives, false negatives, and accepted risks.

Exit evidence: policy is documented, reviewed, and usable without an AI model.

### Phase 1 — Deterministic change-impact detector (P0)

**Goal:** detect likely breakage before broad changes are made.

Deliverables:

- [ ] Inventory changed files from Git.
- [ ] Resolve local imports, aliases, exports, and reverse references.
- [ ] Map routes to handlers, services, frontend callers, tests, and documentation.
- [ ] Detect package manifest and lockfile mismatches.
- [ ] Detect changed environment-variable names and build/runtime classification.
- [ ] Detect CI workflow, Docker, Render, Firebase, and deployment references.
- [ ] Emit machine-readable JSON plus a concise human report.
- [ ] Return non-zero status for broken references and policy violations.

Required checks: syntax/import validation, type checking where applicable, test collection, lint, and production build.

Exit evidence: detector catches seeded import, route, package, and workflow breakages in a fixture repository.

### Phase 2 — Preflight and risk scoring (P0)

**Goal:** turn impact into a consistent decision.

Deliverables:

- [ ] Score blast radius, protected-area involvement, reversibility, data sensitivity, deployment exposure, and validation coverage.
- [ ] Explain every score with file and rule references.
- [ ] Distinguish unknown risk from low risk.
- [ ] Require explicit approval for high/critical changes.
- [ ] Generate an ordered validation plan rather than running arbitrary commands.
- [ ] Store reports as CI artifacts and link them to commit SHA and PR.

Initial rule: unknown dependency or missing validation evidence cannot receive a low-risk label.

Exit evidence: the same change receives the same score across repeated runs and reviewers can override it with a recorded reason.

### Phase 3 — CI and deployment safety gates (P0)

**Goal:** prevent repository changes from silently breaking delivery.

Deliverables:

- [ ] Add import/path drift checks.
- [ ] Add route registry/OpenAPI/frontend caller drift checks.
- [ ] Validate package manifests and lockfiles together.
- [ ] Validate required build-time and runtime configuration names without printing values.
- [ ] Run exact CI-equivalent checks in a clean environment.
- [ ] Add deployment preflight for Docker, Render, Firebase, migrations, health checks, and rollback metadata.
- [ ] Publish a failure classification: code, contract, environment, infrastructure, flaky, or policy.
- [ ] Block merge only on deterministic, reproducible failures; quarantine flaky checks with ownership and expiry.

Do not add AI-generated semantic interpretation as a required CI gate until deterministic gates are stable.

Exit evidence: seeded CI, import, configuration, and deployment failures block the change with actionable output.

### Phase 4 — Repository knowledge graph (P1)

**Goal:** make repository relationships queryable and explainable.

Index only metadata initially:

- files, symbols, imports, exports, aliases;
- routes, schemas, services, callers, and tests;
- package manifests, lockfiles, scripts, workflows, Dockerfiles, and deployment configs;
- environment-variable names and classifications, never values;
- ownership, documentation links, and historical validation evidence.

Deliverables:

- [ ] Version the index by commit SHA.
- [ ] Make indexing incremental and reproducible.
- [ ] Support reverse-impact queries.
- [ ] Preserve source locations for every relationship.
- [ ] Detect stale index state and rebuild safely.
- [ ] Keep the index disposable; source files remain authoritative.

Exit evidence: a reviewer can trace a changed symbol to callers, tests, CI, and deployment references with source locations.

### Phase 5 — AI planning and explanation layer (P1)

**Goal:** use AI where reasoning helps without allowing it to invent safety evidence.

Deliverables:

- [ ] Give the model structured repository facts, not unrestricted secrets or unnecessary source.
- [ ] Ask for a change plan, assumptions, risks, alternatives, and validation sequence.
- [ ] Require citations to indexed files and line ranges.
- [ ] Reject unsupported claims and uncited “safe” conclusions.
- [ ] Separate proposed actions from executed actions.
- [ ] Record model, prompt policy version, input commit SHA, output, and reviewer decision.
- [ ] Add prompt-injection defenses for repository content and tool output.

The model may recommend; deterministic tools decide whether a gate passes.

Exit evidence: AI plans remain useful when the model is unavailable, and unsupported claims are visibly marked as unknown.

### Phase 6 — Sandboxed execution and repair (P1)

**Goal:** permit bounded automation for low-risk changes.

Deliverables:

- [ ] Execute in an isolated workspace with time, memory, process, network, and filesystem limits.
- [ ] Allow only an explicit tool and path policy.
- [ ] Create a checkpoint before mutation.
- [ ] Apply patches atomically and show the complete diff.
- [ ] Run targeted checks before broader checks.
- [ ] Revert automatically when required checks fail.
- [ ] Never silently modify secrets, migrations, protected branches, or production resources.
- [ ] Require human approval before applying high-risk repair suggestions.

Exit evidence: seeded failures can be repaired or cleanly reverted without corrupting the workspace or losing evidence.

### Phase 7 — Learning from outcomes (P2)

**Goal:** improve prioritization without turning history into authority.

Collect:

- predicted risk versus observed failure;
- validation duration and flaky rate;
- accepted/rejected plans and reviewer reasons;
- rollback frequency;
- recurring import, CI, configuration, and deployment failures.

Deliverables:

- [ ] Build a privacy-safe failure taxonomy.
- [ ] Track false-positive and false-negative rates.
- [ ] Use reviewed historical cases to improve heuristics and prompts.
- [ ] Quarantine new rules until evaluated against a regression corpus.
- [ ] Provide deletion and retention controls for stored evidence.

Exit evidence: each rule change has an evaluation report and does not degrade protected-path detection.

### Phase 8 — Progressive autonomy (P2)

Autonomy levels:

| Level | Behavior | Approval |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Observe and report | None |
| 1 | Propose plan and checks | Human review of plan |
| 2 | Run read-only analysis | Human review of conclusions |
| 3 | Apply low-risk reversible patch | Protected CI gates + review |
| 4 | Coordinate bounded repairs | Explicit per-change approval |
| 5 | Production or irreversible action | Always explicit human approval |

Promotion requires measured reliability, rollback testing, audit completeness, and owner approval. No component may self-promote its autonomy level.

## 6. What SupremeAI Must Not Do

- Do not push directly to `main`, production, or a protected branch.
- Do not deploy, migrate, delete, or alter production state from an AI-only decision.
- Do not bypass CI, security scans, approvals, branch protection, or required reviews.
- Do not infer that a file is unused from its filename or from one search result.
- Do not move modules across frontend/backend boundaries without a complete reference map and rollback plan.
- Do not treat a passing unit test as proof of deployment safety.
- Do not print, embed, summarize, or transmit secret values.
- Do not let repository text redefine system policy or tool permissions.
- Do not use localStorage, process memory, or mock status as authoritative persistence for production workflows.
- Do not auto-fix ambiguous auth, tenant-isolation, billing, migration, or security findings.
- Do not implement CAPTCHA bypass, anti-abuse circumvention, stealth keep-alives, or unrestricted self-rewrite.
- Do not allow an AI model to mark its own generated evidence as independently verified.

## 7. Required Safety Gates

Every automated change must pass:

1. clean/known workspace check;
2. scope and protected-path check;
3. dependency and reverse-reference check;
4. secret and policy scan;
5. targeted syntax/import/type checks;
6. targeted tests;
7. full relevant regression checks;
8. build/package/deployment preflight;
9. diff and evidence review;
10. approval and rollback record.

A failed or unknown gate produces `blocked`, not `passed`.

## 8. Metrics and Exit Criteria

Track at minimum:

- import/path breakages caught before merge;
- CI failures caught before push/deploy;
- deployment rollbacks;
- false-positive and false-negative risk classifications;
- percentage of changes with complete impact reports;
- protected-path changes reviewed by humans;
- mean time to isolate a failure;
- evidence completeness and stale-index rate;
- unauthorized or unscoped action attempts blocked.

Do not optimize for number of autonomous changes. Optimize for fewer escaped defects, faster diagnosis, complete auditability, and safe reversibility.

## 9. First 90-Day Implementation Order

### Days 1–30: deterministic foundation

- [ ] Approve policy and risk taxonomy.
- [ ] Build the changed-file/import/reference scanner.
- [ ] Add JSON report and seeded fixtures.
- [ ] Add route/package/config drift checks.
- [ ] Publish the first CI preflight report.

### Days 31–60: gates and evidence

- [ ] Add risk scoring and protected-path rules.
- [ ] Add exact CI-equivalent validation.
- [ ] Add deployment preflight and rollback metadata checks.
- [ ] Store commit-linked evidence bundles.
- [ ] Run the detector in advisory mode, then measure false positives.

### Days 61–90: bounded intelligence

- [ ] Add repository index with source citations.
- [ ] Add AI plan/explanation output behind deterministic facts.
- [ ] Add sandboxed low-risk patch mode.
- [ ] Add review corpus and learning metrics.
- [ ] Decide whether any Level 3 autonomy is justified.

## 10. Definition of Done

This roadmap is implemented only when SupremeAI can take a non-trivial change, identify its impact, explain its risk with citations, select deterministic checks, block unsafe actions, produce reproducible evidence, and recover through rollback when validation fails. A conversational answer that merely sounds intelligent is not completion.

The first implementation target is **Phase 1: deterministic change-impact detector**. It should be specified and delivered through the existing Spec Kit Class B/C workflow before any AI-driven mutation is enabled.

## 🏛️ ৬টি কোর ব্রাউজার মডিউল (The 6 Pillars)

### 💻 Pillar 1: In-App Live Browser Preview Engine (কোড ভিজ্যুয়ালাইজেশন)
AI যখন কোনো ফ্রন্টএন্ড কোড (React, HTML5, Tailwind, Three.js) তৈরি করবে, ইউজার ড্যাশবোর্ডের ভেতরেই সরাসরি তার রিয়েল-টাইম আউটপুট দেখতে পাবে।

- **Iframe Sandboxed Environment:** সুরক্ষিত স্যান্ডবক্স যেখানে ক্লায়েন্ট-সাইড কোড তাত্ক্ষণিকভাবে এক্সিকিউট হবে।
- **Server-Side CORS Bypass Proxy (`/api/browser/proxy`):** যেসব ওয়েবসাইট `X-Frame-Options: DENY` বা CSP দিয়ে ফ্রেম ব্লক করে, সেগুলোকে সার্ভার-সাইড প্রক্সির মাধ্যমে ইন-অ্যাপ ব্রাউজারে রেন্ডার করা।
- **Device Viewport Switcher:** Desktop (1920x1080), Tablet (iPad 768px), এবং Mobile (iPhone 390px) রেজোলিউশনে লাইভ রেসপনসিভনেস টেস্ট।
- **Console Error Trap:** প্রিভিউ আইফ্রেমের সমস্ত কনসোল এরর ও ওয়ার্নিং স্বয়ংক্রিয়ভাবে ইন্টারসেপ্ট করে AI-কে সেলফ-হিলিংয়ের জন্য ফিড করা।

---

### ⚡ Pillar 2: Playwright MCP Automation Tooling (অ্যাকশন এক্সিকিউশন)
AI এজেন্টের জন্য নেটিভ Model Context Protocol (MCP) ইন্টারফেস, যার মাধ্যমে এজেন্ট ব্রাউজারে মানুষের মতো ইন্টারঅ্যাক্ট করে।

- **কোর টুলস:**
  - `browser_navigate(url)`: পেজে যাওয়া ও নেটওয়ার্ক আইডল পর্যন্ত অপেক্ষা করা।
  - `browser_click(selector | text | coordinate)`: বাটন, লিংক বা ট্যাবে ক্লিক।
  - `browser_type(selector, text)`: ইনপুট ফিল্ড ও টেক্সটএরিয়া পূরণ।
  - `browser_screenshot(full_page=True)`: ফুল-পেজ হাই-রেজোলিউশন স্ক্রিনশট ক্যাপচার।
  - `browser_file_upload(path)`: ফর্ম বা পোর্টালে ফাইল আপলোড।
- **Zero Flakiness:** ম্যানুয়াল স্লিপের পরিবর্তে Playwright-এর বিল্ট-ইন auto-wait মেকানিজম।

---

### 🛡️ Pillar 3: Anti-Detection Stealth Shield (বট ব্লকার বাইপাস)
যেকোনো সাইট থেকে সিকিউর ডেটা ও রিসোর্স কালেক্ট করার সময় বট ডিটেকশন এড়ানোর সর্বোচ্চ সুরক্ষা ব্যবস্থা।

- **Fingerprint Masking (`browser_stealth.py`):** WebGL ভেন্ডর, অডিও কনটেক্সট, ক্যানভাস নয়েজ, ব্যাটারি API এবং নেভিগেটর প্রোপার্টিজ হিউম্যানাইজ করা।
- **Cloudflare & Turnstile Bypass:** মাউস মুভমেন্টে Bezier Curve জেনারেট করা এবং ন্যাচারাল কি-স্ট্রোক টাইপিং ডিলে।
- **Zero-Cost Residential/Rotating Proxy Mesh:** রিকোয়েস্ট ব্লক এড়াতে ডাইনামিক প্রক্সি রোটেশন ও হেডার র্যান্ডমাইজেশন।

---

### 👁️ Pillar 4: Multimodal Vision Grounding & Semantic DOM (ভিশন-ভিত্তিক ব্রাউজিং)
কোড না পড়ে মানুষের চোখের মতো স্ক্রিন দেখে ব্রাউজিং করার ক্ষমতা।

- **Vision Grounding (`backend/browser/vision_grounding.py`):** 
  - AI পেজের স্ক্রিনশট নিয়ে বাটন/ইনপুটের কোঅর্ডিনেট `(x, y)` শনাক্ত করবে।
  - ডায়নামিক বা অবফাসকেটেড ক্লাসনেম থাকলেও视觉ভাবে সঠিক এলিমেন্টে ক্লিক হবে।
- **Semantic DOM Pruning (`backend/browser/semantic_dom.py`):**
  - ২০,০০০ লাইনের ভারী HTML-কে মাত্র ৫০০ টোকেনের মিনিফাইড ইন্টারঅ্যাক্টিভ ট্রিতে রূপান্তর।
  - টোকেন খরচ ৯৫% পর্যন্ত কমিয়ে আনা।

---

### 🐝 Pillar 5: Multi-Agent Parallel Swarm Browser (সমান্তরাল সোয়ার্ম ব্রাউজিং)
একটি ব্রাউজার সেশনের বদলে একাধিক হেডলেস সেশনে একযোগে কাজ করা।

- **High-Concurrency Task Partitioning:** ১০টি আলাদা ই-কমার্স বা ডকুমেন্টেশন পেজ থেকে ১ সেকেন্ডে ডেটা সংগ্রহ।
- **Autonomous E2E Testing Swarm:** পুরো ওয়েব প্ল্যাটফর্মে ইউজার ফ্লো (Login -> Checkout -> Payment -> Settings) সমান্তরালভাবে পরীক্ষা করে ক্র্যাশ টেস্ট করা।

---

### 🎮 Pillar 6: Live Screencast & HITL Takeover (হিউম্যান-ইন-দ্য-লুপ)
- **Live Canvas Screencast:** AI ব্রাউজারে কী করছে তা ইউজার ফ্রন্টএন্ডে রিয়েল-টাইম লাইভ ক্যানভাস স্ট্রিমে দেখতে পাবে।
- **1-Click Human Takeover Protocol:** টু-ফ্যাক্টর ওটিপি (2FA OTP) বা ক্যাপচা আসার সময় ইউজার এক ক্লিকে মাউস ও কিবোর্ডের কন্ট্রোল নিয়ে কাজ শেষ করে পুনরায় AI-কে হ্যান্ডওভার দিতে পারবে।
