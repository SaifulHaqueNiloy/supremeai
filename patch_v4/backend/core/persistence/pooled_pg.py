"""Shared, tightly-bounded synchronous Postgres connection pool.

Why this exists: `checkpoint_manager`, `error_pattern_db`, `audit_logger`, and
`memory_service` were previously each opening/closing a fresh sqlite3
connection on every single call, writing to plain files on Render's
ephemeral local disk. That meant their state was silently wiped on every
container restart or redeploy.

Rather than routing them through the app's main *async* SQLAlchemy engine
(which would require converting every caller to async — a large, risky
blast-radius change), these subsystems are synchronous by design and callers
expect that. So we give them their own small psycopg2 pool, pointed at the
*same* Supabase pooler connection string the async engine uses
(SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL_POOLER), with a deliberately tiny ceiling so they
can never crowd out the app's primary request-serving connections.

Ripple-Effect Guard: this module is additive. It does not touch
`database/session.py` or the async engine's pool sizing in any way.

---
PATCH v4 (2026-08-30):
- Production logs showed `ReadOnlySqlTransaction: cannot execute CREATE TABLE
  in a read-only transaction` cascading to ERROR + CRITICAL on every boot.
  Root cause: Supabase production pooler (the URL in `SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL_POOLER`)
  is read-only in our prod tenant, but `pooled_pg.execute()` was running
  DDL (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS) against it via `services.memory_service`,
  `tools.checkpoint_manager`, etc. — all of which then fell back to SQLite
  (silent data loss across restarts).
- Fix: introduce a separate `SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL_WRITER` env var. DDL calls
  go through `execute_ddl()` which only targets the writer URL. DML/query
  calls continue through `execute()` against the pooler (read traffic).
  If no writer URL is configured, `execute_ddl()` logs a single warning
  and returns without raising — callers should treat it as best-effort.
