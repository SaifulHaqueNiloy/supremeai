"""Retry classification for canonical Runs (M1).

Every failure observed by the execution boundary is classified into exactly
one :class:`RetryClass`. The classification decides whether the run may move
``RUNNING -> RETRYING`` (see :mod:`runs.state_machine` guard) or must go to a
terminal / HITL state.

Roadmap M1 enum (fixed, user-approved):

``transient | rate_limited | dependency_unavailable | policy_blocked |
invalid_input | deterministic | resource_exhausted | approval_required``

Pure module — no imports beyond the standard library.
