# Plan 11: Pre-Push & Pre-Commit Verification Guardrails
**Status:** 🔄 **EVOLVED / ACTIVE IN PRE-COMMIT HOOK & CI STATUS SENTINEL**  
**Completion:** ~98% (Local Hook + GitHub Actions Pre-Merge Gate)  
**Priority:** HIGH (P0 Code Quality)  
**Last Updated:** September 2026  
**Domain Circle:** Circle C1 (Code Quality) + Circle C2 (DevOps)

## 🏛️ Architectural Evolution (Bash Script Mock ➔ Live Pre-Commit Hook & GitHub Status Sentinel)
> [!NOTE]
> **Why this evolved from the May 2026 prototype:**
> - **Old Prototype (May 2026):** Basic shell script (`scripts/pre-push.sh`) executing SonarQube and Checkstyle on Java files.
> - **Active Architecture (Sept 2026):** **Multi-Stage Local Pre-Commit Hook** (`.git/hooks/pre-commit` & `.pre-commit-config.yaml`) enforcing:
>   1. **File Size Capping:** Prevents bloated logs (`LESSONS_LEARNED.md` capped at 12KB with auto-rotation).
>   2. **Living Checkpoint Synchronization:** Updates `CHECKPOINT.md` timestamp and tracked file inventory on every commit.
>   3. **Ultra-Fast Ruff Linting & Formatting:** Python formatting in <50ms.
>   4. **Gitleaks Secret Scanning:** Prevents accidental token/key commits.
>   5. **GitHub Actions Sentinel:** Warns agents if the previous remote commit failed CI, mandating fix before push.

## 🎯 Architectural Intent & Overview
Guarantees zero-defect commits by intercepting developer and AI agent commits locally. Fails fast on syntax errors, secret leaks, or broken tests before code ever touches remote branches.

## ⚙️ Active Implementation Details

### 1. Active Pre-Commit Hooks
- **Hook Script:** `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
- **Hook Configuration:** `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- **Secret Protection:** `.gitleaks.toml` & `.secrets-allowlist.json`

### 2. Multi-Stage Automated Checks
- **Stage 1 (Size Gate):** Checks `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` cap (12KB) and triggers archive rotation if exceeded.
- **Stage 2 (Telemetry):** Auto-updates `CHECKPOINT.md` with UTC timestamp and modified file counts.
- **Stage 3 (Formatting & Linting):** Runs `ruff check` and `ruff format` on all staged Python files.
- **Stage 4 (Remote Health Alert):** Queries GitHub Actions API for previous commit run status; issues red alerts on failures.

### 3. Key Active Features
- ✅ Sub-second local execution (Ruff + Gitleaks)
- ✅ Automatic rollback/abort on secret detection
- ✅ Living project state sync into `CHECKPOINT.md`
- ✅ Zero unformatted or syntactically invalid commits allowed
