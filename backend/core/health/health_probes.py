# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Issue #706 — Redis dual-path config drift.
#
# The platform has TWO independently-configured Redis access paths with
# SEPARATE credentials that rotate on separate schedules:
#
#   1. DIRECT TCP ("direct-tcp") — REDIS_URL plus the REDIS_{SECONDARY..QUINARY}_URL
#      federation pool, driven by SecureRedisManager (core/cache/redis_manager.py:82
#      resolves the URL; :290-297 builds the redis.asyncio connection pool).
#      This is the app's HOT PATH — file:line evidence:
#        * core/rate_limit.py:94            (per-request rate limiting →
#                                            redis_manager.get_client_async())
#        * core/cache_manager.py:50         (redis.from_url(self.redis_url))
#        * core/intelligent_cache.py:146    (os.environ["REDIS_URL"] → TCP client)
#        * core/llm/llm_gateway/litellm_runtime.py:51 (litellm redis cache)
#        * core/queue/task_queue_enhanced.py:109      (task queue backend)
#        * middleware/anti_hacking.py:55-57 (per-request security state via
#                                            redis_manager)
#   2. UPSTASH REST ("upstash-rest") — UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL/TOKEN via
#      core/messaging/upstash_redis_queue.py:18-48 (httpx REST client),
#      consumed by brain/parallel_cloud_router.py:50, the shared
#      core/services.py::get_redis_queue() factory, api/routes/admin_auth.py:91-101,
#      plus the MCP tower's redis.ping adapter
#      (infrastructure/mcp-control-plane/src/adapters/redis/index.ts:14-21)
#      and ops scripts (scripts/monitoring/capacity_planner.py,
#      scripts/health/superai_health_check.py, scripts/backup/superai_backup_manager.py).
#
# #706 field data: REST creds valid (PING → PONG 14ms) while the direct TCP
# creds fail auth — the two paths had drifted. Both are now probed and
# reported INDEPENDENTLY; the OVERALL status tracks only the hot path.
#
# Demotion rule (fix #2): if a path were configured but NOT used by the app's
# hot operations (only probed), report it as "unused-configured" instead of
# letting it degrade overall health. Determination for the current tree: the
# direct TCP path IS the hot path (evidence above), so overall health stays
# tied to it and the REST probe is additive visibility — no demotion fires
# today. If the hot path ever migrates to REST, flip REDIS_HOT_PATH to invert.
# Credential rotation itself is an owner action (see #696/#697 checklist).
