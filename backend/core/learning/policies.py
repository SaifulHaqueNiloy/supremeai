"""Bounded adaptation policies — Sprint 5 (smart cache TTL + adaptive threshold).

Pure functions implementing the plan's bounded-adaptation rules:

§13.2 Smart TTL:
    frequently reused + stable  -> longer TTL
    rarely reused               -> shorter TTL
    adaptation never exceeds configured bounds (min/max multipliers).

§7.3 Adaptive threshold (only AFTER sufficient history exists):
    baseline threshold + historical distribution -> bounded adaptive
    threshold with minimum bound, maximum bound, change-rate limit and a
    deterministic, reversible result.

All functions are pure, deterministic and unit-testable; every output is
clamped so no adaptation can run away.
