Regression tests for the RLS 42501 bug class (root cause: migration
17_enable_rls.sql enables RLS on every public table but only creates
policies for tables listed in its category arrays -- anything left out
becomes a silent deny-all, exactly as happened to evolution_logs).

These tests do NOT hit a real Supabase project. They assert the
*contract* that must hold for the fix to be correct:

  1. Group B (system/audit) tables -- evolution_logs, feedback_loop,
     tools_registry, referral_codes, referral_redemptions,
     scheduled_task_executions -- must be written via
     SupabaseDB.service_client, never SupabaseDB.client. If any of these
     is silently switched back to self.client, the RLS 42501 bug returns.

  2. SupabaseDB.client and SupabaseDB.service_client must be genuinely
     independent objects, so that a caller which forgets which one to
     use fails loudly (AttributeError / wrong table) rather than
     accidentally getting bypass access through a shared client.

  3. append_evolution_log() / get_evolution_logs() must not fall back to
     self.client under any circumstance -- this is the exact bug that
     shipped originally.

A live-Supabase smoke test (real anon/authenticated/service-role INSERT
against a disposable project) is intentionally NOT included here -- it
needs real credentials and a network call, so it belongs in a separate
manually-triggered integration job, not the default unit suite.
