## Overview
Comprehensive continuous learning system that captures, processes, and applies knowledge from user interactions, code modifications, and system feedback to improve AI performance over time.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
1. **Knowledge Collector** (`src/main/java/com/supremeai/learning/KnowledgeCollector.java`)
   - Captures learning events from VS Code extension
   - Processes code edits and patterns
   - Validates and sanitizes input data

2. **Learning Processor** (`src/main/java/com/supremeai/learning/LearningProcessor.java`)
   - Analyzes collected knowledge
   - Extracts patterns and best practices
   - Generates learning insights

3. **Knowledge Repository** (`src/main/java/com/supremeai/repository/KnowledgeRepository.java`)
   - Manages Firebase Firestore collections
   - Handles data lifecycle
   - Provides query interfaces

### Firebase Collections Structure

#### ✅ `knowledge` Collection

- Status updates
- Chat history (subcollection)
- Last message timestamps

#### ✅ `requirements` Collection
- Size classification (SMALL/MEDIUM/BIG)
- Approval status
- Processing history
- Auto-approval scheduling

#### ✅ `ai_pool` Collection
- Agent health monitoring
- Quota tracking
- Rotation history
- Performance metrics

#### ✅ `chat` Subcollection
- Message history
