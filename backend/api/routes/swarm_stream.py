"""SSE bridge for the swarm event stream (issue #446).

The frontend EvolutionForge DebateOverlay has called ``GET /api/v1/swarm/stream``
since its introduction, but the route never existed in the live router (the
Phase-1 Router Consolidation deleted ``api.routes.swarm``), so live debate
telemetry was permanently dead.  This module re-exposes the REAL Redis-backed
SwarmPubSub channel as Server-Sent Events — no simulation, exactly the
``{"type": "DEBATE_UPDATE", ...}`` payloads engine/debate_engine.py broadcasts.
