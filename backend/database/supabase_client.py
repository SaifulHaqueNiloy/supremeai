        Previous behaviour tried `SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL_POOLER` first — that
        endpoint is read-only in our production Supabase tenant, so every
        `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` raised `ReadOnlySqlTransaction` and
        cascaded to CRITICAL silent-pattern escalation. The fallback to
        `SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL` (direct) was never reached because the
        except-branch continued to the next URL only after logging a warning.

        New behaviour:
          1. Try `SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL_WRITER` (canonical writer).
          2. Fall back to `SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL` (direct, typically writable).
          3. NEVER try `SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL_POOLER` for DDL — it is read-only
             in production.
          4. If neither writer URL is configured, log a single error and
             return (do NOT silently run DDL against the pooler).
