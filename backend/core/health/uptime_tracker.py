"""
Uptime Tracker
──────────────
Lightweight, dependency-free persistence layer that records every service
health check result and computes rolling uptime percentages (24h / 7d / 30d).

Uses a small local SQLite file so it works out of the box on Render's free
tier without needing a Postgres migration. Safe for concurrent async access
because each call opens/closes its own short-lived connection.

P0 (Task 9-c2): this module is SQLite-only by design. In production without
``SUPABASE_ALLOW_DB_DEGRADATION=true`` the uptime history is DISABLED loudly
(CRITICAL logged once via core.degraded_mode): ``record_check`` becomes a
no-op, and read helpers return "no data" (None / []) instead of ever touching
an ephemeral file. Dev/test behaviour is unchanged.
