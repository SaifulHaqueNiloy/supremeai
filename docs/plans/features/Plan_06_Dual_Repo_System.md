# Plan 6: Unified Monorepo & Multi-Target Deployment Topology
**Status:** 🔄 **EVOLVED / ACTIVE IN TURBOREPO & CLOUD TOPOLOGY**  
**Completion:** ~98% (Turborepo + Docker + Multi-Cloud Staging)  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Last Updated:** September 2026  
**Domain Circle:** Circle C2 (Cloud & Infrastructure)

---

## 🏛️ Architectural Evolution (Fragmented Dual-Repo ➔ Unified Monorepo with Decoupled Cloud Runtimes)
> [!NOTE]
> **Why this evolved from the May 2026 prototype:**
> - **Old Prototype (May 2026):** Attempted to maintain two separate Git repositories (`supremeai-backend` and `supremeai-dashboard`) synchronized with brittle shell scripts (`sync-repos.sh`), causing version drift and broken contract checks.
> - **Active Architecture (Sept 2026):** Consolidated into a unified **Turborepo Monorepo** (`turbo.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`).
> - **Decoupled Deployment:** Codebase is unified for atomic PRs and zero-gap contract validation, while deployments remain decoupled:
>   - **Frontend:** Vercel / Firebase Hosting (`frontend/`)
>   - **Backend Core:** Render Docker Web Service (`backend/`)
>   - **Control Plane:** Render MCP Service (`infrastructure/mcp-control-plane/`)
>   - **Edge Routing:** Cloudflare Workers

---

## 🎯 Architectural Intent & Overview
Delivers single-repository engineering velocity with independent, provider-neutral production deployments. Ensures contract parity across frontend and backend layers with zero cross-repo synchronization friction.

---

## ⚙️ Active Implementation Details

### 1. Monorepo Orchestration
- **Workspace Tooling:** `turbo.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `package.json`
- **Frontend Package:** `frontend/` (Next.js / React with Vanilla CSS & Tailwind tokens)
- **Backend Package:** `backend/` (FastAPI + Poetry / pip)
- **Control Plane Package:** `infrastructure/mcp-control-plane/` (Node.js / TypeScript FastMCP)

### 2. Deployment & Observability Tools
- `render_list_services`, `render_service_health`, `render_get_logs` — Live Render status.
- `cloudflare_worker_status`, `cloudflare_analytics` — Edge CDN and routing health.
- `firebase_hosting_status` — Frontend hosting telemetry.

### 3. Key Active Features
- ✅ Atomic commits preventing frontend/backend API contract mismatch
- ✅ Independent CI/CD build matrix in GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/`)
- ✅ Zero-drift environment secrets via Infisical and Render API
- ✅ Rollback parity across cloud services
