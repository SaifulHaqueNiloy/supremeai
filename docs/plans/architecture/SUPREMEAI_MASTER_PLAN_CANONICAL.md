## 1. Vision & Core Philosophy

### Vision Statement

> স্বপ্নটা ছোট নয়: নিজের হাতে বানানো একটা AI সিস্টেম, যে বড় ল্যাবগুলোর মডেলরা যেখানে সবচেয়ে শক্তিশালী — ঠিক সেই মাঠেই তাদের হারাবে। এই ডকুমেন্ট সেই পুরো পরিকল্পনা — আজকের codebase থেকে production পর্যন্ত, ধাপে ধাপে, খরচের হিসাবসহ, এবং সম্পূর্ণ বাংলায়।

This plan is written entirely in accordance with our **Constitution** (README-র "SupremeAI Constitution"). Every step identifies which principle is in effect — because constitutional shortcuts do not exist in this plan. Its English counterpart is synced with `MASTER_PLAN.md`; where conflicts arise, the scoreboard numbers decide.

### Translating Dream into Engineering Claim

First, honesty. A human-powered project can never beat OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, or Google in **pretraining**. That battlefield costs billions of dollars. Any plan that starts with "we'll train a 70B frontier model" is not strategy — it's fantasy. Our Constitution already tells us why that fight is not ours to take:

- **Eternal Brain (Constitution #1):** SupremeAI's identity is its memory, experience, and capability graph — not any vendor's weights. Frontier models are rented processing engines, whose cost can be reduced to zero.
- **Sustainable Cost (#14):** Minimum sustainable infrastructure. Our budget is small; their power plants. We only fight where this asymmetry doesn't matter.

So the dream translates to an engineering claim:

> **A frontier model, as a raw API, loses on any field where the product is actually the system: verified reliability, task completion, compounding memory, per-solved-problem cost, and language/depth. SupremeAI beats the best "model-as-deployed" players on exactly these fields — and keeps its own small models only where they are actually most useful.**

This is not a consolation prize. Every serious benchmark trend points this way: GAIA proves agents beat raw models on real tasks; SWE-bench hard tasks are system problems; cost-per-task leaderboard decides real adoption. The moat is not the model — the moat is what surrounds the model, which we are already building.

## 2. Chosen Battlefields & Rejected Arenas

| # | Battlefield | Who We Beat | Why We Win | Constitution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | **Verified Reliability (pass^k)** | Frontier APIs tuned for pass@1 demos — but *inconsistent*; same hard question 3 times gives 3 different answers | Governed verify-loop + `pass^k` gate (`core/self_benchmark.py`, shipped this sprint) measures and enforces consistency. We can honestly report pass^3 — they cannot | Verification Before Trust (#5), No Silent Failure (#13) |
| B2 | **Agentic Task Completion** | o3/GPT-4-class *as-deployed* (raw chat API — no memory, no capability discovery, no repair loop) | Capability-Composition Model + governed execution + retry/failover. GAIA-style: tool-chaining beats assumption-only models | Reuse Before Creation (#3), One System Many Surfaces (#10) |
| B3 | **Cost Frontier** | Every commercial API | Zero-cost provider chain, Tier0 fast path, semantic cache, TokenJuice compression, scout's zero-token summarizer. We beat on **cost per verified task** — the metric nobody else wants to publish | Sustainable Cost (#14) |
| B4 | **Compounding Memory** | Every API call starting from zero | Hierarchical memory tree + Auto-RAG + learning loop + experience DB. Task #50 is cheaper, faster, and more reliable than task #5. They never learn | Memory Must Compound (#11), Eternal Brain (#1) |
| B5 | **Bengali + Regional Depth** | Top models are weakest on low-resource languages; nobody builds for Bangladesh | We already normalize Bengali (`BengaliNormalizer`), write our own docs in Bengali, and Phase 3 will train a dedicated Bengali adapter. On this field we are *native*, they are *tourists* | Provider Agnostic, User Loyal (#9) |
| B6 | **Integration Surface (MCP federation)** | Single-vendor tool ecosystems | Governed MCP federation gateway (shipped), one-URL connect, capability registry. Any model can sit behind our fabric; no single lab can match our reach | Capability Sovereignty (#2), Dynamic Discovery (#4) |

**We do NOT fight on:** raw parameter count, frontier reasoning benchmarks, multimodal scale, pretraining size records. That fight consumes our only resource — time — against opponents who have a thousand times more of it.

**Honest scoreboard we will publish:** B1–B6 each gets a measurable number (§8 gate). When the number says we won, we won — not when marketing says so. This is *Deliver honestly*.

## 3. Current State Audit

### What We Already Have (Strengths)

- **4 live services** on Render (core, worker, scraper, MCP tower) + Cloudflare edge failover circuit breaker — *Graceful Degradation works today*.
- **Zero-cost LLM chain** (Gemini/Groq/OpenRouter/Ollama) with multi-key support; 18 quality patches from senior-review merged upstream.
- **Governance spine:** HITL engine + append-only audit ledger, RLS tenant isolation, policy-governed MCP federation, constitution-governance CI.
- **Memory:** pgvector RPC recall path, Auto-RAG injection in chat/SSE pipeline, hierarchical memory tree.
- **Governed scout crawler** — hardened: per-domain rate pacing, robots.txt compliance, per-hop redirect re-validation, full event coverage, fail-closed policy.
- **Reliability gate:** unbiased `pass^k` estimator (`C(s,k)/C(n,k)`) in `core/self_benchmark.py`.
- **Learning loop** (`core/learning/`): privacy-scrubbed events from LLM gateway; proposals never auto-apply.

### What Was Gap — And Phase 1 Patch Closed

| Gap | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Scout crawler unwired in research pipeline (dead code from API perspective) | specs/002 | ✅ **Alive this patch** — `_web_search` now scout-first |
| `crawler_admin` had only create/list; events was hardcoded placeholder | specs/002 | ✅ Full CRUD + real telemetry + DB persistence |
| Reasoning-chain SSE channel dead; `ReasoningLog.tsx` forever "Waiting..." | ROADMAP_BANGLA Sprint 2 | ✅ `reasoning` channel alive; frontend receives data |
| `/connections/register` didn't write to `ConnectionRegistry`; fake connection_id | UNIVERSAL_ZERO_COMPLEXITY | ✅ write-through + real id (health-probe promotion open) |
| `ConfigValidationReport` was doc-only; CORS had two parallel paths | specs/001 | ✅ Report class + resolver unification + contract test |
| `/api/v1/admin/stats|users|audit-logs` 404 | MASTER_PLAN Phase 1 | ✅ Real endpoints |
| Mission-level E2E benchmark suite missing | README "most valuable future tests" | ✅ First 5 missions + pass^3 in CI |
| 125 test skips untracked | PRODUCTION_ROADMAP | ✅ `docs/SKIPPED_TESTS.md` rebuilt (baseline + triage) |
| Own model adapter not trained | This plan (Phase 3) | ⏳ Next phase work |

**Gate (Constitution #13):** Zero "alive-looking but dead inside" features. Every status page tells the truth.

## 4. Strategy: System Defeats Models, Then Trains Its Own

One paragraph, the whole plan:

1. **Finish the machine** — Close every promised-but-unwired capability so the capability graph is honest and complete (own backlog: Reuse Before Creation).
2. **Measure reliability** — pass^k and mission test CI gates; every change justified by scoreboard, not vibes.
3. **Spin the flywheel** — Every solved task produces governed training data (scout corpus + learning events + verification outcomes + feedback).
4. **Small, lean — own model** — Train own adapters (Bengali, behavioral alignment, router/verifier) on flywheel data; canary + pass^k gate before promotion. Eternal Brain: own weights, own registry, swappable.
5. **Public benchmark attack on chosen fields** — Beat top *deployments* on B1/B2/B3/B5 with proof.

Every step in this report uses existing machinery. This is not circular — it is Constitution's *Reuse Before Creation* strategy in application.

---

## 5. Phase Roadmap: Phase 0 → Phase 6

### Phase 0 — Stop the Bleeding (Weeks 1–2) ✅ Complete

**Goal:** Every shipped feature actually works; every number is honest.

- Fix broken wiring: connections camelCase contract (UI was reading `undefined`), remove duplicate `detect_protocol`, clear dead `ready_states`, `user_execution_mode` migration, `CapabilityUnavailableExplainer` render, real connections in workspace Zero-Friction registry.
- Fix governance violations: RLHF no longer creates fake records or "simulation success"; honestly rejects training on empty data.
- Harden scout: rate pacing, robots.txt, redirect re-validation, full events, fail-closed.
- Housekeeping: Supabase `ai_memory` Phase C table, rebuild `docs/SKIPPED_TESTS.md`, delete stray log files, rotate Render keys.

**Gate (Constitution #13):** Zero "alive-looking but dead" features.

### Phase 1 — Capability Completion (Weeks 3–8) 🚧 Core shipped in this patch

**Goal:** Capability graph matches our plan corpus promises.

- **Scout goes live** ✅ — deep research web search now scout-first: governed crawl respecting tenant's active `CrawlPolicy` (robots.txt, rate pacing, SSRF gate, dedup), browser fallback; durable persistence in `crawl_policies`/`crawl_history`/`crawl_events` tables (Alembic `2026_09_13_090000`); full admin CRUD (PATCH / enable / disable / DELETE) and real `GET /events`; governed `research` capability in conversation orchestrator. Research answers now cite governed sources — B2 fuel.
- **One connection registry** ✅ — `/connections/register` now write-through to `ConnectionRegistry`, real record id; open: health-probe promotion (IDEA→MEASURED) and execution-mode UI.
- **Reasoning stream** ✅ — `emit_reasoning_step()` sends thought-steps to session SSE `reasoning` channel; `ReasoningLog.tsx` finally shows agent thinking. Visible intelligence, reified.
- **Config hardening** ✅ — `ConfigValidationReport` (required vars, format, CORS wildcard), `server.py` origins now driven by `cors_policy` resolver, `GET /config/validation-report`, contract test.
- **Admin surface** ✅ — `/api/v1/admin/stats|users|audit-logs` alive with real data (was 404).
- **Mission suite kickoff** ✅ — First 5 missions / 12 tests; `scripts/ci/mission_passk.py` first pass^3 in CI; `docs/SKIPPED_TESTS.md` rebuilt.

**Gate (Constitution #3):** No new subsystems this phase — just closing promised items. "Near-ready" capability → "available".

### Phase 2 — Reliability Mass (Weeks 9–16)

**Goal:** *Measurable reliability* becomes the product's core metric. This is B1.

- **Mission tests:** 20 real end-to-end user missions — research, file work, repo repair, scheduling — auto-scored. Mission suite `pass^3 ≥ 0.8` is the promotion bar for every future change. First 5 missions shipped this patch; remaining 15 this phase.
- **Risk-Tiered Safety Pipeline** (`docs/architecture/RISK_TIERED_AUTONOMOUS_SAFETY_PIPELINE.md`): "Simple by default, deep by risk" operationalized — L1 deterministic rule gate, L2 parallel GitHub matrix, L3 independent adversarial reviewer ("assume it's wrong"), browser staging simulator, automatic runtime rollback.
- **Governed Multi-Agent Decision Framework**: Cost-Minimized Execution ($0 capability ladder, duplicate reasoning reuse) + Continuous Project-Scoped Security + Cross-Agent Challenge Matrix (Security vs Cost vs Safety).
- **CI gates expand:** pass^k harness on nightly live zero-cost chain; coverage gate 30→50 backend / 16→30 frontend; skip count 125→<30, every waiver tracked in `docs/SKIPPED_TESTS.md`.
- **Performance:** Remaining sync-in-async stalls fixed, PgBouncer tuning, Tier0 hit-rate ≥ 40% on repeat traffic.
- **Migration unification:** Alembic canonical, `database/migrations/legacy/` archived.

**Gate (Constitution #5):** Nothing — model, adapter, provider, or code — promotes without pass^k number.

### Phase 3 — Own Model v1: Small, Lean, Ours (Months 4–6)

**Goal:** "Own-built AI model" begins — not a frontier clone, but adapters that are *small yet beat big ones* because the tasks are small and the data is ours. Eternal Brain becomes real.

- **Data flywheel (Memory Must Compound → training data):**
  - Scout corpora: governed crawl + zero-token extractive summary (zero cost, per-tenant scoped);
  - Learning events: privacy-scrubbed from gateway;
  - Verification outcomes: every verify-before-trust result labeled with its own trace;
  - Explicit feedback: `/feedback` → `RLHFPipeline` with provenance (dataset_version, source).
- **Three adapters, three battlefields:**
  1. **Bengali conversation adapter** (B5): base = open 2–7B instruct model; flywheel Bengali pairs + scout-Bangla corpus for LoRA/DPO fine-tuning. Target: beat Gemini/GPT-class on Bengali conversational quality and idiom at 1/50 cost — "their own strength" argument reverses here, because this field is our native.
  2. **Behavioral alignment adapter** (B1 helper): resurrect dead `behavioral_intelligence` package (4 missing modules: `intent_signals`, `preference_store`, `evaluator`, `metrics`); train on interaction signals to match user's preferred response style (concise vs step-by-step vs code-first).
  3. **Router/verifier micro-model** (B3 helper): 0.5–1B classifier that routes requests and judges output within the verify-loop — replaces thousands of paid verification calls with local decisions; pass^k goes up *and* cost goes down.
- **Training infrastructure already in repo:** `pipelines/synthetic_data_pipeline.py` → `tools/learning/rlhf_pipeline.py` (now real) → `tools/learning/model_trainer.py` (RunPod/Modal LoRA) → `core/kaggle_orchestrator.py` (free Kaggle GPU, ~30 hrs/week) → promotion via `evolution/canary_manager.py` behind pass^k gate.
- **Serving:** Adapter registered as another provider entry in gateway — Graceful Degradation: if adapter is cold, chain transparently falls back to Groq/Gemini. User experience never depends on our model being warm.

**Gate (Constitution #7, Reversible Evolution):** Adapter reaches production only when it beats its own base model on its own eval-set by ≥10% and pass^3 does not regress. Rollback path always warm.

### Phase 4 — Public Benchmark Attack (Months 7–9)

**Goal:** Prove it on chosen fields. Public numbers are the one-man army's marketing department.

- **B1 — Reliability:** Mission suite pass^k curve of SupremeAI vs raw frontier API. Expectation: frontier API crushes on pass@1, collapses on pass^3/pass^5; our verify-loop keeps pass^k high. This chart is the pitch.
- **B2 — Task Completion:** GAIA-text subset + governed executor for SWE-bench-lite-style repo-repair harness; same underlying model — *without our machinery*. This proves the "system is the moat".
- **B3 — Cost:** Cost-per-verified-task published. Zero-cost chain + Tier0 + cache + scout summarizer vs paid stacks at comparable quality tier — the numbers should be embarrassing for them.
- **B5 — Bengali:** Governed-source Bengali eval set (conversation, summarization, code-switching); our adapter vs the giants. Native wins.

**Gate (Constitution #5, #13):** Every published number must be reproducible from a committed script. No benchmark theater.

### Phase 5 — Production Hardening & Launch (Months 10–12)

**Goal:** "It works for me" → "It works for a stranger."

- SLA enforcement wired to our exported metrics (P95 < 2s chat first-token, error < 1%); 10× load test on current traffic; OpenTelemetry end-to-end trace.
- Security re-audit (30-category matrix) + pen-test pass; secrets rotation automation; TOTP on all admin paths.
- Thin-client launch (VS Code extension + desktop): 100% thin, zero user keys, local Ollama as only offline fallback — CHECKPOINT.md architectural memory, preserved.
- Onboarding funnel: one-URL connect → first verified task < 5 minutes.
- **The Founder's Demo:** Public page showing live system-truth — uptime, pass^3, solved tasks, cost per task, adapter eval. Radical transparency is the brand.

**Gate:** 99.5% monthly uptime in quartile, within P95 targets, zero open P0 security findings.

### Phase 6 — Compounding (Year 2)

**Goal:** Capability graph grows at a rate no human can match by writing features.

- Self-evolution flywheel fully operational: agent-breeder proposal → sandbox eval → pass^k gate → canary promotion → capability registry. System proposes its own capabilities; I approve.
- MCP marketplace economy: tenants publish governed capabilities; registry compounds by everyone's contribution.
- One-man army becomes one-person *orchestra* — SupremeAI runs its own ops, testing, repair, and roadmap drafting; I audit, decide, and steer.

## 6. Data Flywheel — Why Each Phase Gets Cheaper

```
User Task ──► governed execution ──► verified result
                      │                     │
          scout corpus (zero-token)    verification label
                      │                     │
                      ▼                     ▼
          learning_events (privacy-scrubbed) + feedback
                                    │
                                    ▼
                       synthetic_data_pipeline
                                    │
                                    ▼
                    LoRA/DPO adapter (small field)
                                    │
                         pass^k gate + canary
                                    │
                                    ▼
                  gateway adapter serves ──► next task even cheaper, faster,
                                              more reliable
```

The flywheel is Constitution's *Memory Must Compound* "recall" elevated to "weights". Every real task either (a) solves with existing capability — already cheap — or (b) leaves data that makes every similar future task permanently cheaper. Big labs can copy this; their flywheel needs scale. Ours needs the system we already run.

---

## 7. One-Man-Army Operating System

Time is the scarcest resource; operational reality demands this structure:

- **50% product / 30% ops / 20% engineering.** Product = user-visible capability. Ops = reliability, data, adapters. Engineering = building the machine.
- **Relentless dogfood:** Every patch (this sprint too) is built through the same governed pipeline — plan → execute → verify → audit. If the pipeline hurts, that's the bug list. SupremeAI files its own GitHub issues; AutoHealer monitors; learning loop drafts roadmap (I approve). *One System, Many Execution Surfaces* — founder is also just another tenant.
- **Budget math (Sustainable Cost):**
  - Render free/low tier (core, worker, scraper, MCP) + Supabase free (pgvector) + Upstash free (Redis) + Cloudflare free (edge) — roughly $0–25/month;
  - LLM: zero-cost chain (Groq/Gemini/OpenRouter free tier + local Ollama) — baseline ~$0;
  - Training: Kaggle free GPU (~30 hrs/week) for LoRA/DPO; RunPod burst ~$20–50/month only when promotion gate justifies;
  - **Total: under $75/month** — attacking all four battlefields. The asymmetry IS the strategy.
- **Decision rule for every new idea:** *Reuse → Compose → Adapt → Extend → Create.* If you can't say which existing capability an idea extends, it waits. Backlog is long; compounding only happens when I finish things.
- **Kill criteria (honesty about risk):** If Phase 2 ends and mission-suite pass^3 doesn't reach 0.7, the verify-loop design is wrong — redesign before Phase 3. If Bengali adapter doesn't beat zero-cost chain on its own eval by Phase 3 end, park own-model and double down on B1/B2/B3. If infra friction persists beyond 20% of time for 2 consecutive months, consolidate services. This plan is not dogma — it is commitment.

## 9. Recent Implementation Patches (2026-09-13)

**Patch scope:** 29 files, +2,059 / −88 lines  
**Base branch:** `main` @ `8833e9d`  
**Date:** ১৩ সেপ্টেম্বর ২০২৬

This patch implemented **4 old-plan features** + **4 production-hardening items** + **7 hidden bug fixes**. Everything codebase-verified, tested, and documented with Bengali comments.

### Part 1: 4 High-Value Features (Now Actually Implemented)

#### Feature 1: 1-Line MCP Connection UX + Glassmorphic Dashboard Polish

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `frontend/src/index.css` | **[MODIFY]** `.glass-panel`, `.glass-input`, `.pulse-ring`, `.node-active` utilities + `pulse-neon`/`node-beat` keyframes; `body.light` and `prefers-reduced-motion` support |
| `frontend/src/components/dashboard/OneLinerMCPConnect.tsx` | **[NEW]** One URL connects MCP/AI-Provider/Webhook — Enter key support, inline success/error card |
| `frontend/src/components/dashboard/OneLinerMCPConnect.test.tsx` | **[NEW]** 5 vitest tests |
| `frontend/src/components/dashboard/ConnectedPlatformsVault.tsx` | **[MODIFY]** OneLinerMCPConnect embedded above vault |
| `backend/services/integration_discovery.py` | **[NEW]** `IntegrationDiscoveryService` — MCP handshake (`/.well-known/mcp.json`) → AI provider hostname patterns → webhook reachability, 3-step auto-detect |
| `backend/api/routes/integrations.py` | **[MODIFY]** `POST /api/v1/integrations/discover` endpoint (JWT-guarded) |

#### Feature 2: Auto-RAG Memory Injection (audit G-3 — now ✅)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `backend/core/memory/auto_rag_injector.py` | **[NEW]** `AutoRAGInjector` — recalls top-5 relevant memories from pgvector before each request and prepends to prompt; stores successful exchanges via `store_session_memory()`. Score threshold (0.55), tenant-isolation, **silent graceful degradation** |
| `backend/core/memory/__init__.py`, `backend/core/ai_memory/__init__.py` | **[NEW]** Package init |
| `backend/api/routes/stream_chat_sse.py` | **[MODIFY]** Injection in `SafeSSEGenerator` + memory-store at stream end — **this endpoint had NO memory injection before** |
| `backend/api/routes/chat.py` | **[MODIFY]** Added `user_id` to recall — previously other tenant's memories were recalled (bug fix) |

#### Feature 3: Biometric Stealth Fingerprint Layer

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `backend/core/human_behavior.py` | **[MODIFY]** `apply_stealth_fingerprint()` — Canvas noise, WebGL vendor/renderer spoof (37445/37446), `navigator.webdriver` removed, realistic plugins, 6-set random viewport; never throws exception |
| `backend/services/scraper/browser_agent.py` | **[MODIFY]** `navigate_and_interact` and `execute_recipe` — both wired with stealth call |
| `backend/tests/test_stealth_browser.py` | **[NEW]** 5 tests |

#### Feature 4: Cloudflare Worker → Backend Auto-Failover Circuit Breaker

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `infrastructure/cloudflare/enhanced-worker.js` | **[MODIFY]** `proxyToOrigin` now priority-ordered multi-node failover: 8s timeout per node, 5xx/network failure stores OPEN circuit in KV (2min TTL = auto HALF-OPEN recovery), JSON 503 after last node fails |
| `infrastructure/cloudflare/wrangler.toml` | **[MODIFY]** `BACKUP_RENDER_URL`/`TERTIARY_RENDER_URL` vars + `SUPREME_KV`/`DUPLICATE_DB`/`CACHE_METADATA` KV bindings declared |

**Plus 3 critical worker bug fixes** (see Part 3 below).

### Part 2: 4 Production-Hardening Items

#### 1. Scraper Service Access Guard (P1) ✅

`backend/api/routes/scraper.py` — `/scrape`, `/browse`, `/recipe` all three:
- `Depends(get_current_admin)` — admin JWT now required for **HTTP 401**; regular user gets **403**
- `asyncio.Semaphore(SCRAPER_MAX_CONCURRENCY)` — capacity exhausted returns **HTTP 429**, no queue waiting
- **Bonus:** sync `fetch_page` httpx call moved to `asyncio.to_thread` — event loop no longer blocked (standalone service parity)
- `/health` intentionally kept public (uptime monitoring)

#### 2. JWT Revocation — Admin Fail-Closed (P1) ✅

`backend/core/security/__init__.py` + `auth_middleware.py` + `api/routes/auth.py`:
- `is_token_revoked(jti, *, is_admin=False)` — **admin + Redis down = fail-CLOSED (reject)**; regular user = fail-open (Render cold-start no lockout)
- TTL-aware `_ADMIN_REVOCATION_CACHE` LRU (max 1000 entries, thread-safe `OrderedDict`) — even if Redis is down, most recent revoked admin tokens are caught
- `verify_token` / `verify_token_async` now determine admin from payload's `role` claim (`admin`/`master_admin`)
- `AuthMiddleware` — revocation check failure returns 401 for admin token, previous behavior for user token
- `logout`/`revoke_token` — role-aware admin-cache write
- `backend/tests/security/test_admin_fail_closed.py` — 9 tests

#### 3. localStorage → httpOnly Cookie Migration (P1) ✅

Backend already existed (`_set_auth_cookies` called in login/register/refresh — commit `78ddb9b`); frontend remainder completed in this patch:

`frontend/src/store/authStore.ts` — `initialize()`:
- Even without localStorage token, calls `/auth/me` with `credentials: 'include'` to detect and restore **cookie-only session**
- Both modes work (dual-mode transition) — no breaking change; old localStorage sessions unaffected
- 2 new tests in `authStore.test.ts` (total 12 passing)

#### 4. Memory Service Phase-2: pgvector RPC (P2) ✅

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `backend/database/migrations/legacy/001_pgvector_match_fn.sql` | **[NEW]** Run once in Supabase SQL Editor — `CREATE EXTENSION vector`, TEXT→vector guarded conversion, ivfflat index, **`match_ai_memories`** RPC (user/session filtered, unconstrained vector — both 384/1536 dims work) |
| `backend/services/memory_service.py` | **[MODIFY]** `query_context()` — cached probe hits pgvector for DB-side ranking (RPC), falls back to previous 2000-row Python-cosine fallback; **384/1536 dim mismatch fix** (`_PG_DIM` contract) |

### Part 3: 7 Hidden Bug Fixes (Outside Plan, Found in Codebase Audit)

| # | Bug | File | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | `caches.default.putToCache()` — nonexistent API; every GET `/api/*` cache-miss returned 500 | `enhanced-worker.js` | **Production-down-level** bug |
| B2 | AI cache key had `await` missing before `sha256Hash()` — key contained `"[object Promise]"` | `enhanced-worker.js` | AI caching never worked |
| B3 | Default route had `fetch(request)` — worker called itself | `enhanced-worker.js` | non-API traffic never reached origin |
| B4 | `DUPLICATE_DB`/`CACHE_METADATA` used in code but not declared in wrangler.toml | `wrangler.toml` | TypeError on POST `/ai/*` |
| B5 | `vector_store.upsert_batch` awaited sync Supabase client — always failed, no memory persisted | `core/ai_memory/vector_store.py` | Entire Auto-RAG store path was inactive |
| B6 | `chat.py stream_chat` recall didn't send `user_id` — tenant-isolation miss | `api/routes/chat.py` | Cross-tenant memory leak risk |
| B7 | `engine/vector_db.py` `query_context(query=, limit=, threshold=)` — wrong kwargs; TypeError silently swallowed | `engine/vector_db.py` | Experience recall always empty |

### Verification Report (in this sandbox)

```
✅ New backend tests:       30/30 passed
   (Auto-RAG 10 + Stealth 5 + Fail-closed 9 + Scraper-guard 6)

✅ ruff lint:               All changed files clean
✅ node --check (worker):   Syntax clean; TOML valid
✅ Secret-leak scan:         No credentials/keys in this patch
```

### Patch Application Instructions

```bash
cd supremeai
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git apply --check SUPREMEAI_FEATURE_PATCH.patch   # dry run
git apply SUPREMEAI_FEATURE_PATCH.patch
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: implement 4 old-plan features + 4 production hardening items + 7 bugfixes"
```

> **Note:** If conflicts arise, use `git apply --3way SUPREMEAI_FEATURE_PATCH.patch`.

### Post-Deployment Manual Steps (Outside Code)

1. **Supabase SQL Editor:** Run `backend/database/migrations/legacy/001_pgvector_match_fn.sql` once — this activates `match_ai_memories` RPC (system falls back without it, only fast path disabled).
2. **Cloudflare:** `wrangler kv namespace create SUPREME_KV` (+ `DUPLICATE_DB`, `CACHE_METADATA`) — paste created IDs into `wrangler.toml`'s `REPLACE_WITH_*` placeholders, then `wrangler deploy`. Put your secondary Render node URL in `BACKUP_RENDER_URL`.
3. **Postman verification:** Without admin JWT, `POST /api/v1/browse` → should return **401**.
4. **Frontend:** Login → DevTools → Cookies → verify `supreme_access_token` has `HttpOnly ✓`; new `/workspace` page should show **⚡ 1-Line Connect** panel.
5. **Env keys:** Your shared `4.env` keys were not used/committed in this patch — propagation to Infisical/Render follows your `.env` file header notes. Remember to revoke after testing.

### Forward Roadmap (per audit Priority-B/C — Next Sprint)

| Step | Work | Audit Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Sprint 2 | `match_ai_memories` RPC as primary path for `recall_memories()` (dim contract aligned with Supabase 3-param version) | Gap-9 |
| Sprint 2 | `BranchPoint.tsx` + `parent_message_id` — conversation branching | G-6 |
| Sprint 2 | `ReasoningLog.tsx` backend streaming-step feed | G-7 |
| Sprint 3 | `intent_router.py` post-response hook — proactive next-step hints | G-8 |
| Sprint 3 | `pr_reviewer.py` unified-diff inline comments | G-9 |
| Sprint 3 | Cron-builder UI + `scheduler.py` self-serve tasks | G-10 |
| Sprint 4 | MCP Marketplace module (control-plane) | G-4 |
| Sprint 4 | pass^k reliability metric — `self_benchmark.py` | Gap-4 |
| Sprint 5 | `UnifiedModelRouter` convergence (10 routers → 1) | §7.2 |

> **Core principle immutable:** We are not the model — we are the orchestrator. Every new feature is built within Zero-Hardcoding, Free-Tier-First, Tenant-Owned, and HITL principles.

## 10. Strategic Analysis & Gap Assessment (2026-09-04)

**Date:** ৪ সেপ্টেম্বর, ২০২৬  
**Version:** v1.1 (corrected — Tips 5 and 7 made constitution-compliant)  
**Repository:** github.com/SaifulHaqueNiloy/supremeai (main branch, ৯৪৮ কমিট)

> **v1.1 Correction Notes:**
> - **Tip 5 (old):** "Make Ollama Dev Fallback" — ❌ Cancelled. SupremeAI Cloud will not run Ollama.
> - **Tip 5 (new):** User-Local Ollama Bridge — only used if user's device has Ollama, auto-detected via Capability Discovery. Backend pressure reduction strategy.
> - **Tip 7 (old):** "Make Groq Primary Fast Inference" — ❌ Cancelled. This is a hardcoded decision violating Constitution's "Dynamic Discovery over brittle hard-coded inventories" principle.
> - **Tip 7 (new):** Dynamic Model Performance Learning — system learns from real performance data which model works best for which task.

### Executive Summary

**Direct answer: Yes, your master plan is effective — but it is currently ~40% implemented, 35% partial, and 25% paper-only. 6 major gaps have been identified and 12 actionable tips provided to maximize free-tier benefit.**

Your project's vision — "Capability Before Construction" and "Eternal Brain" — is genuinely thoughtful and long-term. However, `MISSING_SERVICES_INTEGRATION_PLAN_V4.1.md` describes many services that are still "Configured but not Production-Active". Especially **Sentry Performance (0%), Cloudflare Workers (0.18%), Codespaces (0%)** are effectively unused. Details below.

### Codebase Overview (per README.md)

| Layer | Technology | Current Status |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | React 19 + TypeScript + Vite 7 | ✅ Active (MultiWorkspace) |
| Core API | Python 3.11 + FastAPI + Async SQLAlchemy 2.0 | ✅ Active (Render Docker) |
| Database | PostgreSQL + pgvector (Supabase) | ✅ Active (36% utilized) |
| Cache/Queue | Redis / Upstash | ✅ Active |
| LLM Gateway | Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, Ollama | ✅ Fallback chain active |
| Browser | Playwright + Chromium | ✅ Active (Scraping Node) |
| MCP Tower | Node.js MCP Server | ✅ Active |
| Edge | Cloudflare Worker (Keep-Alive Cron) | ⚠️ 4-node `*/8` cron running, but 0.18% utilized |
| Hosting | Firebase Hosting | ✅ Active |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions + GHCR | ✅ Active (৯৪৮ কমিট) |
| Secrets | Infisical | ⚠️ 83% capacity utilized |
| Thin Clients | Tauri/Electron Desktop + VS Code Ext | ✅ Ready (Zero Key Exposure) |

### Current State (per STATUS.md)

- **Active Phase:** Phase 3 — Self-Evolving & Multi-Agent Swarm
- **Production Readiness:** Verified in local Docker cluster; live on cloud
- **Total Completed Milestones:** 15 (AutoHealer, DB Indexing, HITL Ledger, design system, etc.)
- **High-Priority Pending:** 3 — Supabase `ai_memory` verification, CI Coverage Gates, Action SHA Pinning

### Gap Analysis — 6 Major Gaps

#### 🔴 Gap 1: "Aspirational vs Implemented" Gap

| Service | Plan Target | Current Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Sentry Performance | 50% | **0%** 🔴 |
| Cloudflare Workers | 40% | **0.18%** 🔴 |
| GitHub Codespaces | 50% | **0%** 🔴 |
| Render Hours | 45% | **69%** ⚠️ (over-use) |
| Langfuse | Active | **Absent** 🔴 |

**Reason:** Plans were written, but the "Activation PR" was never merged.

#### 🔴 Gap 2: Render Free Tier Sleep + 69% Hour Usage
- Render Free Tier: **750 hrs/month**, 15 min idle → Sleep
- 4 services × 24 hrs × 30 days = **2,880 hrs needed**, have 750
- **Plan gap:** No concrete "Service Consolidation" plan exists

#### 🔴 Gap 3: Supabase 7-Day Inactivity Pause (Not Mentioned in Plan)
- 7 days without DB activity → Supabase project pauses
- Eternal Brain (`ai_memory`) becomes inactive → entire memory system dead
- **Plan gap:** This risk has no mention

#### 🔴 Gap 4: Multi-Account Resource Pooling Toothless Plan
- "Multi-account pools" exist in architecture, but API Key Rotation, IP binding, ToS compliance — no concrete guide
- **Risk:** Wrong moves can get provider accounts banned

#### 🔴 Gap 5: Browser Automation Resource Reality
- Render Free Tier: **512 MB RAM, 0.1 CPU**
- Playwright + Chromium alone consumes ~300-400 MB RAM → OOM inevitable
- **No solution in plan:** Cloudflare Browser Rendering API or Cloudflare Tunnel for external execution

#### 🔴 Gap 6: Hardcoded Model-Task Mapping (New Addition)
- Plan has hardcoded candidate list in router: `[0-30] → Gemini, Groq, Ollama...`
- This violates Constitution's **"Dynamic Discovery"** and **"Memory Must Compound"** principles
- When models change (new versions, new quotas, new strengths) code must change — system never learns
- **Solution:** See Tip 7

### Free-Tier Pro Tips — 12 Actionable Items

#### 🥇 Tip 1: Save Render Hours — Service Consolidation
**Problem:** 4 separate Render services = 4× hour cost  
**Solution:** Combine Core + Worker in one Dockerfile (with Supervisor), Scraper separate  
**Result:** 4 services → 2 services = 750 hrs sufficient

```yaml
# render.yaml (snippet)
services:
  - type: web
    name: supremeai-combined
    env: docker
    dockerCommand: "./start-combined.sh"
```

#### 🥈 Tip 2: Cloudflare Workers as Edge Gateway (0.18% → 40%)

- **Request Router:** `/api/*` proxied to Render, cacheable GET responses cached at CF Edge
- **DDoS Protection + Rate Limiting:** Built-in on free tier
- **Cloudflare KV** for Session Cache

#### 🥉 Tip 3: Supabase 7-Day Pause Prevention via GitHub Actions Cron

```yaml
# .github/workflows/supabase-keepalive.yml
name: Supabase Keep-Alive
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 6 * * *"
jobs:
  ping:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: |
          curl -X POST "${{ secrets.SUPABASE_URL }}/rest/v1/rpc/ping" \
            -H "apikey: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }}"
```

#### 💡 Tip 4: Multi-Account LLM Pooling (Safely)

Multiple Google Cloud Projects for separate `GEMINI_API_KEY` (ToS-safe):
- Per project: 1,500 RPD (Flash) → 5 projects = 7,500 RPD free

```python
class GeminiPool:
    def __init__(self, keys: list[str]):
        self.keys = keys
        self._quotas = {k: ProviderQuota(k, 1500, 0, ...) for k in keys}

    async def get_key(self) -> str:
        available = [k for k, q in self._quotas.items() if q.status == "available"]
        return min(available, key=lambda k: self._quotas[k].used_today)
```

#### 💡 Tip 5 (Corrected): User-Local Ollama Bridge — User's Device as Capacity Provider

**Core principle:** SupremeAI Cloud will never assume Ollama exists. Ollama is a **user-authorized local capability**, auto-detected via Capability Discovery. This is the direct implementation of your README line:

> *"User-authorized external capabilities"* — a layer of the Capability Surface.

**Why it's powerful:**
- User's local inference = **no cloud LLM quota cost**
- No Render compute pressure (inference happens on user's CPU/GPU)
- User's data stays on their device — Privacy benefit
- Works offline — consistent with your "Graceful Degradation" principle

**Architecture (leveraging your existing Thin Client):**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ User's Device                        │
│  ┌────────────────┐  ┌────────────┐  │
│  │ SupremeAI      │  │  Ollama    │  │
│  │ Desktop (Tauri)│─▶│ :11434     │  │
│  │ / VS Code Ext  │  │ (local)    │  │
│  └───────┬────────┘  └────────────┘  │
└──────────┼───────────────────────────┘
           │ 1. Ollama detect: GET localhost:11434/api/tags
           │ 2. Capability registration (with user consent)
           ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SupremeAI Cloud (Render)             │
│  Capability Registry:                │
│  { id: "user_local_ollama",          │
│    owner: user_id,                   │
│    type: "llm",                      │
│    scope: "user-only",               │
│    online: bool }                    │
│                                      │
│  Router: simple task + user's        │
│  own request → user_local_ollama     │
│  everything else → cloud providers   │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Detection code (in Desktop Client):**

```typescript
// Tauri/Desktop client — runs only with user consent
async function discoverLocalOllama(): Promise<LocalCapability | null> {
  try {
    const res = await fetch("http://localhost:11434/api/tags", {
      signal: AbortSignal.timeout(2000),
    });
    if (!res.ok) return null;
    const data = await res.json();
    return {
      id: "user_local_ollama",
      type: "llm",
      models: data.models?.map((m: any) => m.name) ?? [],
      scope: "user-only",       // only this user's tasks
      registeredAt: Date.now(),
    };
  } catch {
    return null; // No Ollama — nothing happens, cloud proceeds normally
  }
}
```

**Cloud-side routing rules (Dynamic, not Hardcoded):**
- If `user_local_ollama` is **online** in Capability Registry AND the task is the user's own → suggest routing locally (HITL-compliant)
- If local call fails/times out → automatic cloud fallback ("No Silent Failure")
- If Ollama offline → mark `online: false` in Registry

**Result:** Backend pressure ↓, LLM quota savings ↑, user Privacy ↑ — and no Hardcoded Assumptions.

#### 💡 Tip 6: HuggingFace Serverless Inference — Know the Real Limits

- **Cold Model Loading 30-60 seconds** — unsuitable for real-time
- **Tip:** Only for your **own custom models** (supreme-coder-3b etc.) in batch/async tasks
- Let Tip 7's Learner decide when HF is valuable — don't decide in code

#### 💡 Tip 7 (Corrected): Dynamic Model Performance Learning — No Hardcoded Routing

**Core principle:** "Which model works best for which task" — **nobody writes this in code.** The system measures real outcomes for every call, stores them in Eternal Brain, and routes based on that data. This is the direct implementation of your Constitution:

> *"Memory Must Compound: Task → Result → Experience → Memory → Better Future Planning"*

**Current problem (in your plan):**

```python
# ❌ Current (hardcoded candidate lists):
if complexity_score <= 30:
    return ['ollama', 'gemini', 'groq', 'huggingface']  # why? who decided?
```

**Solution: `ModelPerformanceLearner`**

```python
# backend/services/llm/performance_learner.py
"""
Dynamic Model Performance Learner
No model-task mapping is ever hardcoded.
Every LLM call's real outcome is measured → stored in Eternal Brain →
future routing decisions based on that data.
"""
class ModelPerformanceLearner:
    async def record_outcome(
        self,
        task_type: str,          # classified at runtime, not hardcoded
        provider: str,
        model: str,
        latency_ms: float,
        tokens_in: int,
        tokens_out: int,
        success: bool,
        quality_score: float | None,  # automatic for verifiable tasks
    ):
        """Called once per LLM call — from llm_gateway"""
        fact = (
            f"model_performance: task={task_type} provider={provider} "
            f"model={model} latency_ms={latency_ms:.0f} success={success} "
            f"quality={quality_score} at {datetime.utcnow().isoformat()}"
        )
        await self.memory.store_learned_fact(
            fact_text=fact,
            embedding=self.embedder.embed_text(fact),
            metadata={
                "kind": "model_performance",
                "task_type": task_type,
                "provider": provider,
                "model": model,
                "latency_ms": latency_ms,
                "success": success,
                "quality": quality_score,
                "window": "recent",
            },
        )

    async def recommend_models(self, task_type: str, k: int = 3) -> list[dict]:
        """Historical best performers from memory — no hardcoded lists.
        If no data → exploration mode (equal opportunity for all available providers,
        results recorded; system learns in a few days)."""
        results = await self.memory.query_learned_facts(
            query=f"model performance for task {task_type}",
            metadata_filter={"kind": "model_performance", "task_type": task_type},
            limit=50,
        )
        if not results:
            return []  # exploration mode active
        scored = self._aggregate_recent(results, window_days=14)
        return sorted(scored, key=lambda s: s["score"], reverse=True)[:k]
```

**Router integration (in your existing `smart_model_router`):**

```python
async def route_request(self, task, complexity_score: int):
    task_type = await self.classifier.detect(task)          # runtime classification
    learned = await self.learner.recommend_models(task_type)
    candidates = (
        [m["model"] for m in learned]                       # 1. learned data first
        or await self.registry.list_available()             # 2. fall back to exploration
    )
    for candidate in candidates:
        result = await self.try_provider(candidate, task)
        await self.learner.record_outcome(task_type, candidate, result)
        if result.success:
            return result
    return self.degrade_gracefully(task)                    # Honest failure
```

**Quality score derivation (for verifiable tasks, no extra LLM cost):**

- Code generation → syntax parse + test pass (your IDE Trio Stage 3 already does this!)
- Summarization → output length/structure heuristic + user rating
- Retrieval/RAG → citation hit rate
- Others → latency + success rate is sufficient signal

**Benefits:**
- Model updates/new providers → **no code change** — system learns in 1-2 days
- Quota exhausted → automatically falls back to next best alternative (your "Graceful Degradation")
- Old assumptions clean themselves — Retention Policy prunes old performance facts
- Groq, Gemini, HF — **none get special status**; best data wins

#### 💡 Tip 8: Vercel vs Firebase Hosting (Frontend)

- **Vercel Hobby:** Unlimited Static, 100 GB bandwidth, Preview Deployments (free)
- **Firebase Hosting:** 10 GB bandwidth — less
- **Tip:** Keep Firebase for now; plan migration if traffic grows

#### 💡 Tip 9: Cloudflare R2 — Artifact Storage (10 GB free, Egress free)

- Store `artifacts` files in R2
- 10 GB free, **no Egress Fee**
- Permanent solution to Render's ephemeral disk problem

#### 💡 Tip 10: Upstash Redis Free Tier Used Correctly

- **10,000 Commands/day** free
- Uses: Session Cache, Rate Limiting, Distributed Lock, Semantic Cache
- **Caution:** Enabling Keyspace Notification quickly exhausts quota

#### 💡 Tip 11: Modal/Replicate/Together Free Credits

For heavy tasks (3D Model, Video, Heavy Compute):

- **Modal:** $30/month free credit
- **Replicate:** Free trial for new accounts
- **Together AI:** $25 free credit
- Add these to your `Burst Compute` layer — but Tip 7's Learner should evaluate their value

#### 💡 Tip 12: Langfuse Self-Hosted (LLM Observability)

- **Option A:** Langfuse Cloud free (10K observations/month)
- **Option B:** Self-host on Render — completely free, unlimited
- **Bonus:** Langfuse trace data becomes Tip 7's Learner input (provider latency, token usage)

```python
from langfuse import Langfuse
langfuse = Langfuse()

# After LLM call:
langfuse.trace(
    name="chat_completion",
    input=prompt,
    output=response,
    metadata={"provider": provider, "model": model, "latency_ms": latency},
)
```

### Final Verdict

#### ✅ What the plan gets right

1. **Capability Composition Model** — "Reuse before Create" philosophy is professional
2. **Multi-Provider Abstraction** — Vendor lock-in free
3. **Local-first Embedding (MiniLM + zero-pad)** — Clever approach
4. **Governance (HITL + RBAC + Audit)** — Enterprise-grade thinking
5. **Documentation culture** — `AGENTS.md`, `STATUS.md`, `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`
6. **Thin Client architecture** — Perfect foundation for Tip 5's Ollama Bridge

#### ⚠️ What makes the plan weak

1. **Aspiration vs Implementation Gap** — Much is "configured" but not "active"
2. **No Resource Reality Check** — Render's 512 MB RAM cannot run Chromium
3. **Supabase 7-day Pause Risk** — Completely overlooked
4. **Quota Myth:** Groq 14,400/day assumed, actual limit is 30 RPM
5. **Hardcoded model-task mapping** — Violates own Constitution's "Dynamic Discovery" principle (Tip 7 solves this)
6. **User-Local Capability absent from plan** — No plan to use user's device (Ollama) as capacity provider (Tip 5 solves this)

### Final Word

Your master plan is **wonderful for dreaming, 60% ready for execution.** Implementing the 12 tips above lets you run a Production-Ready AI Platform for **$0-10/month**. The two most important architectural decisions:

1. **Tip 7 (Performance Learner):** The system should learn from data, not from code — this is the real proof of the "Eternal Brain" vision.
2. **Tip 5 (User-Local Bridge):** The user's device is the first capacity provider — minimum cloud cost, maximum privacy.

> **"The compounding capability graph — not the number of individual services — is the real product."**
> — From your own README. This graph now has two new nodes: **the user's device** and **the system's own learned data**.

## 11. Revolutionary Concepts

### Multi-Perspective "Swarm Consensus"

**Current AI weakness:** ChatGPT or Claude answers from a single model. If that model has bias or hallucination, the user gets wrong answers.

**SupremeAI's out-of-the-box solution:**
- One prompt triggers 3 virtual sub-agents in the background: **Architect**, **Red Team (hacker/critic)**, and **Synthesizer**.
- Architect creates solution, Red Team finds weaknesses/attacks, Synthesizer resolves contradictions into an unbreakable consensus answer.
- User gets response in a blink, but depth is many times greater than ordinary AI.

### Zero-Code Dynamic Sandbox Tooling

**Current AI weakness:** Without a specific tool or integration, general AI says "I don't have that tool" or asks the developer to manually code an API integration.

**SupremeAI's solution:**
- If user says "parse this weird data format into a graph and send to Telegram" — SupremeAI doesn't wait for a pre-built plugin.
- It generates a **micro-function (Ephemeral Micro-Script)** in its in-memory Python in milliseconds, runs it, gets the result, and safely garbage-collects the code afterward.
- No developer intervention needed — it can create tools on its own for any unknown task.

### Human-Like "Synaptic Dream Cycle" Memory

**Current AI weakness:** AI memory means general text vector search (RAG), which pulls irrelevant things and wastes tokens.

**SupremeAI's solution:**
- Like human brain processing memories during sleep, SupremeAI runs a **"Synaptic Dream Cycle"** in the cloud.
- Automatically removes unnecessary information from thousands of daily chats and permanently weaves working patterns, coding styles, and life goals into a high-quality **Knowledge Graph & Heuristic Rules**.
- User never has to remind the system of their preferences or past again.

### Proactive Predictive Intelligence

**Current AI weakness:** All AI is **"Reactive"** — answers only when user asks, never initiates work on its own.

**SupremeAI's solution:**
- SupremeAI is **"Proactive"**. It monitors user's GitHub repo, cloud logs, and code change trends in the background.
- Before user asks, SupremeAI tells them in dashboard or notification:
  > *"Niloy, your deployment file has memory limit low, next traffic spike may crash. I've already drafted a fix and test — do you approve with one click?"*
- This is not just a chatbot — it's your 24/7 **Chief Technology Partner**.

### Self-Mutating Code Evolution (Darwinian Code Optimizer)

**Core concept:**
- SupremeAI backend algorithms measure their own code performance via genetic algorithms.
- If any API call takes more than 200ms, it writes an alternative variant in the background and benchmarks it.
- If the new variant is faster and more resource-efficient, it proposes to human central governance as a pull-request.
- System proposes its own capabilities; I approve.

## 13. Historical Analysis Archive

### Project Deep Analysis — May 2026

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** May 12, 2026  
**Status:** Living MVP

**Current state:** SupremeAI is in a "Living MVP" phase. Its core infrastructure has started working in reality, but some advanced automated features are still under research and awaiting implementation.

**What works in practice:**
- **Learning Engine:** Firebase integration verified. System can observe developer code edits and error reports in IDE and store data to improve itself.
- **Full-stack code generation:** Spring Boot backend and React frontend code generation service is active. Can create not just text prompts, but JPA entities and REST controllers.
- **Multi-agent orchestration:** Logic to change agent count from 0 to infinity as needed is working in practice, helping keep the system active even when API limits are exhausted.

**Architectural intelligence:**
- **Self-healing:** Code is checked by another agent for errors after writing (Court Check).
- **Intent analysis:** System can distinguish between user's permanent rules and temporary instructions.
- **Cost control:** 80% threshold rotation policy for API keys demonstrates practical intelligence.

**Gaps & challenges:**
- **Simulator Controller (Plan 22):** Still 0% complete. Real simulator runtime for testing generated mobile apps remains to be built.
- **Reverse Engineering (Plan 23):** Python logic to automatically create API connectors from websites exists, but hasn't been integrated into the main system as a scalable microservice yet.
- **Publishing pipeline:** The process of automatically uploading apps to app stores or play stores is still in the planning phase.

**Recent failures:**
- Google Cloud Run deployment showing `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors
- IntelliJ Plugin build showing Kotlin K2 mode-related reference errors

**Final verdict:** SupremeAI is currently a very powerful **Development Accelerator**. If you use it today, it reduces your boilerplate code writing by at least 10x. But it is still maturing towards the goal of being a complete "autonomous business partner".

**Next targets:**
1. **Simulator runtime:** Direct browser testing of generated apps.
2. **Business intelligence:** Integrate reverse engineering and marketing modules into core system.
3. **Permission fix:** Resolve `PERMISSION_DENIED` error in Google Cloud deployment.
4. **Daily assistant:** Add voice and vision support for productivity enhancement.
