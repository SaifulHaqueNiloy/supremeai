# SUPREMEAI FREE-TIER MULTI-SERVICE SCALE MASTER PLAN

**Version:** 1.0 — September 2026
**Purpose:** Combine legitimate free/no-cost service tiers to maximize SupremeAI capacity while keeping the architecture policy-safe, observable, replaceable, and ready for paid escalation.

## 0. Executive Decision

SupremeAI should **not** build a “free cloud supercomputer” by multiplying provider quotas through many accounts.

The durable architecture is:

> **One SupremeAI brain → one capability/policy control plane → many legitimate execution surfaces → aggressive caching/batching/deduplication → queue/backpressure → user-authorized resources → external delegation → paid burst capacity only when genuinely required.**

The uploaded earlier blueprint contains useful service-mapping ideas, but several of its claims must not be production guarantees. Free Colab is explicitly non-guaranteed, dynamic, and intended to prioritize interactive notebook use; Google documents that distributed computing workers and UI-bypass patterns are restricted in free managed runtimes. Google Cloud terms also prohibit quota circumvention through multiple accounts/projects intended to simulate one resource. Therefore the earlier “Colab keep-alive / stealth / relay” and “account multiplication = quota multiplication” patterns are rejected.

The objective is not **“get as much free compute as possible.”** The objective is **“do the most useful work per unit of scarce compute.”**

---

# 1. Scaling Constitution

### Rule 1 — Free tier is an optimization layer, never the correctness foundation

Every provider must sit behind a replaceable adapter. SupremeAI must remain correct if any free quota changes tomorrow.

### Rule 2 — Never confuse accounts with capacity

Multiple legitimate environments are fine when justified by tenancy, ownership, isolation, geography, security, or provider-supported architecture. They must not be used solely to manufacture quota unless the provider explicitly permits it.

### Rule 3 — User-owned resources remain user-owned

A user may connect GitHub, model providers, storage, SaaS, or other authorized resources. SupremeAI can discover and use capabilities within the granted scope, but must not silently turn one user's private resource into shared infrastructure.

### Rule 4 — Optimize work before servers

Priority order:

1. deduplicate
2. cache
3. reuse memory/capabilities
4. compose existing capabilities
5. batch
6. route lightweight work to edge/serverless
7. route heavy work to suitable execution surfaces
8. add capacity only after measurement

### Rule 5 — No provider is a single point of correctness

SupremeAI must degrade gracefully when any single provider sleeps, rate-limits, becomes unavailable, changes pricing, or disappears.

# 3. Service-by-Service Strategy

## 3.1 Firebase Hosting — Frontend Delivery

**Use heavily for:** React/TypeScript assets, SPA delivery, static content, client-side caching, public docs, UI configuration.

**Scaling trick:** avoid making every UI interaction an origin API call.

```text
Browser cache → CDN → edge cache → API only when necessary
```

Firebase documents CDN-backed Hosting and project-level no-cost quotas. citeturn618240search8turn618240search4

**Do not use it as:** the dynamic AI execution layer.

---

## 3.2 Cloudflare Workers — Edge Layer

Current Workers Free limits include **100,000 requests/day**, **10 ms CPU/request**, 50 subrequests/request, and 5 Cron Triggers/account. citeturn618240search7

### Best use

- request normalization
- cache lookup
- rate limiting
- authentication pre-checks
- idempotency
- deduplication
- lightweight MCP dispatch
- routing
- WAF/abuse filtering
- health aggregation
- signed URL validation
- small transforms

### Bad use

- GPU execution
- heavy Python
- Playwright
- long-running agents
- large repository indexing
- arbitrary Docker workloads

Why: free CPU/memory/runtime constraints make it an edge tool, not a compute warehouse. citeturn618240search7

---

## 3.3 Render — Lean Core Control Plane

Render Free web services can spin down after **15 minutes without inbound traffic** and take about a minute to wake; local filesystem state is ephemeral. citeturn618240search5

### Render should own

- FastAPI
- authentication/session orchestration
- task creation
- planning
- policy
- provider selection
- small synchronous operations
- webhooks/status delivery

### Render should not own

- GPU work
- huge repository analysis
- large embedding batches
- video generation
- long-running agents
- unbounded browser jobs

### Sleep strategy

Do not make “keep pinging forever” a correctness dependency. Design:

```text
request → wake → admit task → return job ID → async execution elsewhere
```

Cold start becomes UX latency, not a system failure.

---

---

## 3.3.1 Render Node 4 — MCP Control Tower (Zero-Cost Universal Tool & Context Bridge)

SupremeAI operates a dedicated, isolated Render Free microservice node (supremeai-mcp-tower / Node 4) implementing the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** specification.

### Purpose and Value

- **Universal Context Bridge:** Aggregates live metadata, state, and resources across 17+ integrated cloud services (Render, Supabase, Firebase Admin SDK, Infisical, GitHub, Upstash Redis, Cloudflare, Resend, Stripe, etc.) through standardized MCP resources (mcp://context/*).
- **Standardized Tool Surface:** Exposes tools (mcp://tools/*) to client agents, IDE extensions, and the core planner without hardcoded bindings or sensitive token leaks to thin clients.
- **Resource & Quota Protection:** Maintains per-tool rate limiting, caching, and circuit breaking before hitting downstream APIs.
- **Zero-Cost Keepalive Integration:** Enrolled in the Cloudflare Edge Worker cron (*/8 * * * *) and GitHub keepalive pipeline alongside the primary, worker, and scraper nodes, ensuring 24/7 readiness at  infrastructure cost.

### MCP Control Tower should own

- Unified MCP server protocol endpoints (/mcp/v1, /health, /sse, /tools/call)
- Dynamic service capability discovery and tool introspection
- Secure credential delegation (mediated strictly through Infisical vault)
- Standardized execution telemetry for tool invocations

### MCP Control Tower should not own

- Long-running heavy batch workloads (delegated to Async/Worker Node)
- Durable relational database storage (delegated to Supabase pgvector)
- Direct user-facing web frontend rendering (delegated to Firebase/Cloudflare)

## 3.4 Supabase — Durable Intelligence Memory

Current Supabase Free lists **500 MB database**, **1 GB file storage**, **5 GB egress**, **50,000 MAU**, and inactivity pausing; only two active free projects are allowed. citeturn618240search6

### Store

- users/tenants
- permissions
- task metadata
- memory metadata
- capabilities
- provider/resource registry
- audit events
- lessons
- important embeddings
- durable configuration

### Do not store forever

- every prompt token
- duplicate API payloads
- every intermediate result
- raw browser pages forever
- huge logs
- temporary artifacts

Use retention classes:

| Class | Example | Retention |
|---|---|---|
| Hot | active task/session | short |
| Warm | recent execution | medium |
| Knowledge | validated capability/lesson | long |
| Archive | compressed artifacts/logs | long/offloaded |
| Disposable | temporary data | delete |

**Memory must become more useful over time, not merely bigger.**

---

## 3.5 Upstash Redis — Scarce Coordination Layer

Current Upstash Redis Free lists **256 MB data** and **500,000 commands/month**; the pricing page also lists a **10 GB bandwidth** limit for Free. citeturn618240search2

### Use for

- short-lived queues
- hot cache
- locks
- leases
- idempotency
- rate limiting
- task fingerprints
- small coordination state

### Do not use for

- primary DB
- permanent history
- large files
- large vectors
- giant queue payloads

### Critical trick

Prefer:

```text
one logical task → few batched Redis operations
```

over a design where every tiny state transition becomes a separate Redis command.

---

## 3.6 GitHub Actions — Repository-Native Compute

GitHub Free currently lists **2,000 Actions minutes/month** and **500 MB artifact storage** for private repositories; standard GitHub-hosted runners on public repositories are free. citeturn618240search0

### Best use

- test
- lint
- build
- packaging
- dependency scanning
- SBOM generation
- release automation
- repository-specific background work

### SupremeAI pattern

```text
SupremeAI
 → user authorization
 → GitHub repository
 → Actions
 → tests/build
 → artifact
 → verify
```

The advantage is not “many accounts = more minutes.” The advantage is **work executes where the repository already lives.**

---

## 3.7 Kaggle — Research / Batch Surface

Kaggle currently documents a weekly GPU quota around **30 hours**, varying with demand/resources, and recommends actively monitoring GPU usage. citeturn757771search2

### Good

- research notebooks
- benchmarks
- model evaluation
- dataset analysis
- reproducible ML experiments
- non-urgent batch work

### Bad

- production API
- permanent queue worker
- SLA-critical customer inference
- hidden worker fleet
- account multiplication for quota pooling

Kaggle also notes that resource/promotion terms can change and misuse can lead to suspension. citeturn757771search3

---

## 3.8 Google Colab — Interactive Research Surface

Google says free Colab limits are dynamic and non-guaranteed; usage, hardware availability, idle periods, and maximum runtime can vary. Free runtimes can run up to 12 hours depending on usage/availability. Google also explicitly restricts distributed computing workers and bypassing the notebook UI in free managed runtimes. citeturn757771search0turn757771search1

### Therefore reject

- stealth keep-alive
- fake mouse activity
- automatic Connect-button clicking to defeat idle policies
- reverse tunnel as a hidden production worker
- CAPTCHA solving to preserve sessions
- relay of multiple accounts for permanent compute

Google's Colab Terms additionally prohibit sharing/access arrangements that provide direct or indirect access to Colab by third parties. citeturn757771search10

### Legitimate role

- admin/developer experiments
- notebook research
- interactive user workflows
- education/tutorial work
- model prototyping

Colab should be optional. SupremeAI must work normally when Colab is absent.

---

# 4. Strongest Scaling Tricks

## 4.1 Work Shaping

The biggest optimization is often to avoid doing work at all.

```text
1,000 equivalent tasks
      ↓
1 canonical computation
      ↓
verified reusable result
      ↓
reuse where privacy/policy permits
```

---

## 4.2 Layered Cache

```text
L0 Browser
L1 CDN/Edge
L2 Redis
L3 Supabase validated knowledge
L4 External provider/model
```

Before an expensive call:

```text
memory?
→ existing capability?
→ cached result?
→ cheaper provider?
→ only then expensive execution
```

---

## 4.3 Content-Hash Artifacts

For deterministic artifacts:

```text
artifact_hash = SHA256(normalized_input)
```

If the same input already has a verified result, reuse it.

Useful for:

- dependency graphs
- SBOMs
- static analysis
- repository indexes
- embeddings
- package metadata

---

## 4.4 Semantic Deduplication

Exact hashes are insufficient for equivalent natural-language tasks.

Use task fingerprints + semantic similarity to detect requests that can share a validated answer/capability.

Never cross tenant boundaries with private user data.

---

## 4.5 Batch Execution

Convert:

```text
100 small embedding jobs
```

to:

```text
1 batched embedding job
```

Especially useful for indexing, evaluation, static analysis, and repository processing.

---

## 4.6 Async UX

Heavy work should not block the HTTP request.

```text
submitted → queued → running → verifying → completed
```

This lets finite compute serve bursts without crashing the API.

---

## 4.7 Backpressure

When capacity is full:

```text
queue
→ estimate wait
→ offer cheaper route
→ offer async completion
→ offer user-owned resource
→ paid burst only when permitted
```

Do not blindly retry.

---

# 5. Intelligent Execution Classes

| Class | Example | Preferred surface |
|---|---|---|
| A: Edge | cache, auth pre-check, dedup | Cloudflare |
| B: Core | planning, policy, task admission | Render (Primary Node) |
| C: Async I/O | webhooks, external waits | queue + lightweight worker (Worker Node) |
| D: Tool & Context | unified 17+ service MCP context & tools | Render Node 4 (supremeai-mcp-tower) |
| E: Repository-native | test/build/security | GitHub Actions |
| F: Research/batch | benchmark/model experiment | Kaggle/Colab where permitted |
| G: Heavy production | GPU, video, large inference | authorized external/paid compute |
---

# 6. Cost- and Quota-Aware Router

Create:

```text
Capability → Execution Class → Candidate Providers
```

Provider score should consider:

```text
fit
+ reliability
+ latency
+ verification history
+ authorization fit
- cost
- quota pressure
- maintenance cost
- risk
```

Example resource model:

```json
{
  "provider": "github",
  "resource": "user-actions",
  "remaining": 1200,
  "reset_at": "...",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "current_load": 0.31,
  "historical_failure_rate": 0.03
}
```

Never interpret unknown quota as unlimited.

---

# 7. ResourceBudgetGuardian

Create a central budget/capacity service responsible for:

- quota observation
- exhaustion prediction
- reservation of scarce capacity
- waste prevention
- batching
- optional workload deferral
- provider failover
- paid escalation
- capacity warnings

Example policies:

```text
Upstash near limit
 → reduce cache chatter

GitHub Actions near limit
 → defer optional CI

Kaggle budget low
 → move non-urgent evaluation

Supabase storage near limit
 → compress/archive/delete disposable data
```

---

# 8. Retry and Failure Engineering

Use:

```text
bounded retries
+ exponential backoff
+ jitter
+ idempotency
+ circuit breaker
+ error classification
```

Never repeatedly retry permanent failures:

- invalid credentials
- invalid input
- policy rejection
- missing permission
- hard quota exhaustion

Retry selectively for transient failures such as temporary 5xx/network failures.

---

# 9. User-Owned Service Ecosystem

When a user connects a resource:

```text
Connect
 ↓
inspect APIs/capabilities
 ↓
map permission scopes
 ↓
measure limits/cost
 ↓
register capabilities
 ↓
use permitted capability
 ↓
verify
 ↓
learn reusable pattern
```

Example for GitHub:

```text
repository
issues
pull requests
Actions
releases
artifacts
packages
security metadata
```

Model the distinction:

> **Capability != Permission**

A connected service may expose a capability, but SupremeAI must still have explicit authorization to invoke it.

---

# 10. Multi-Tenant Safety

Store user/resource ownership explicitly.

Example:

```json
{
  "resource": "github-account",
  "owner_tenant": "tenant_A",
  "permissions": ["repo", "actions"],
  "capabilities": ["read_repository", "run_action"],
  "cost_model": "user_owned",
  "risk_level": "medium"
}
```

Generic capability knowledge may be reusable; private customer data must not be.

---

# 11. Massive-User Reality

Separate these metrics:

- registered users
- DAU
- concurrent active users
- backend requests
- model calls
- heavy-task concurrency
- external-provider concurrency

For example, 100,000 registered users can still be manageable if most work is:

```text
client/CDN/cache
```

and only a small fraction reaches expensive backend/model execution.

Do not publish “50,000 users guaranteed” or “2,000 heavy users guaranteed” until real load tests and observed workload distributions support it.

---

# 12. Heavy-User Strategy

For thousands of heavy users, do not promise zero-cost unlimited real-time compute.

Use:

```text
admission control
→ cache/reuse
→ batch
→ async queue
→ user-owned execution where available
→ provider distribution
→ paid burst when genuinely necessary
```

The free tier is a cost reducer, not infinite supply.

---

# 13. Optional Client-Side Compute

Use client compute only as an optional accelerator.

Good candidates:

- compression
- small AST parsing
- local document preprocessing
- WebAssembly transforms
- privacy-preserving local transforms

The backend must still work when the client contributes zero compute.

---

# 14. Memory as the Long-Term Scaling Advantage

SupremeAI should retain:

- working memory
- episodic memory
- semantic memory
- procedural memory
- resource memory
- cost memory
- failure memory

Long-term loop:

```text
Task
 ↓
Plan
 ↓
Execute
 ↓
Verify
 ↓
Measure cost/quality
 ↓
Learn
 ↓
Reuse
```

The best “free compute” is computation SupremeAI no longer needs to perform.

---

# 15. Observability

Track:

```text
request/user
cache hit rate
semantic cache hit rate
queue depth
latency
provider failure rate
quota remaining/reset time
Redis commands/task
DB writes/task
bytes/task
AI tokens/task
compute/task
retries/task
verification failures
cost avoided by reuse
```

Important KPI:

### Compute Avoidance Rate

```text
work avoided through cache/reuse
--------------------------------
all requested work
```

---

# 16. Security and Governance

Sensitive actions must follow:

```text
Observe
→ Analyze
→ Risk
→ Permission
→ Approval
→ Act
→ Verify
→ Audit
```

Protect third-party credentials with:

- least-privilege scopes
- short-lived tokens where supported
- encrypted secret storage
- rotation
- per-task authority
- audit trails

Never put provider secrets in frontend source, normal logs, Redis payloads, or generated code.

---

# 17. Failure Matrix

| Failure | Expected behavior |
|---|---|
| Cloudflare unavailable | direct/fallback API path where safe |
| Render asleep | wake + admission; treat delay as latency |
| Upstash unavailable | degraded queue/cache path; no false success |
| Supabase unavailable | pause durable-state operations; preserve truthful state |
| AI provider rate-limited | route to another authorized provider |
| Kaggle unavailable | queue or move batch work |
| Colab unavailable | no core regression |
| GitHub Actions exhausted | defer or use another permitted execution route |

---

# 18. Architecture Invariants

These must remain true regardless of future free-tier changes:

1. SupremeAI works without Kaggle.
2. SupremeAI works without Colab.
3. SupremeAI works without multiple provider accounts.
4. Heavy tasks can degrade to async execution.
5. No quota circumvention is required.
6. Paid escalation does not require an architectural rewrite.
7. User-owned resources remain user-owned.
8. No single provider owns the SupremeAI brain.

# 22. Load-Test Plan

Before making capacity claims, run:

### A — 100 identical requests
Expected: high dedup/cache hit rate.

### B — 1,000 read-heavy requests
Expected: majority served by browser/CDN/edge/cache.

### C — 500 heavy queued jobs
Expected: no crash; controlled queue growth; honest progress states.

### D — Redis outage
Expected: graceful degraded mode.

### E — Render sleep
Expected: wake latency but no logical failure.

### F — Provider 429s
Expected: routing/fallback behavior.

### G — Provider quota exhausted
Expected: alternate authorized path or queue/defer.

### H — Revoked user authorization
Expected: capability removed immediately; no unauthorized fallback.

### I — Colab unavailable
Expected: zero core regression.

### J — Supabase storage threshold reached
Expected: retention/archive policy activates.

# 26. Final North Star

SupremeAI should become:

> **A resource-aware autonomous operating system for AI work — not a collection of free servers.**

The canonical loop is:

```text
User Goal
 ↓
Understand
 ↓
Search Memory
 ↓
Find Capability
 ↓
Compose Capability
 ↓
Check User-Owned Resources
 ↓
Check Free/Low-Cost Providers
 ↓
Estimate Cost + Risk + Quota
 ↓
Choose Best Route
 ↓
Execute
 ↓
Verify
 ↓
Cache / Learn / Reuse
 ↓
Improve Future Routing
```

When capacity is scarce:

```text
reduce work
→ reuse work
→ queue work
→ batch work
→ delegate to authorized resources
→ use user-owned resources
→ pay for burst capacity only when justified
```

### The real SupremeAI scaling trick

> **Do not try to own all compute. Make SupremeAI need as little new compute as possible.**

That makes free tiers an accelerator rather than a dependency, which is the safer long-term strategy for a low-maintenance SupremeAI.
