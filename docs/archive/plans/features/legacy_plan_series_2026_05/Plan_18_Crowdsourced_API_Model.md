# Plan 18: Crowdsourced API Model

## Status: 🔴 **CRITICAL**
## Completion: ~70%
## Priority: LOW
## Last Updated: 2026-05-04

---

## Overview
Community-driven API model system that aggregates, validates, and distributes API knowledge, patterns, and best practices from multiple contributors to create a comprehensive, continuously improving API ecosystem.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
1. **API Collector** (`src/main/java/com/supremeai/crowdsource/APICollector.java`)
   - Community API submission
   - API metadata extraction
   - Initial validation

2. **Quality Validator** (`src/main/java/com/supremeai/validation/QualityValidator.java`)
   - API quality assessment
   - Security validation
   - Performance verification

3. **Model Aggregator** (`src/main/java/com/supremeai/aggregation/ModelAggregator.java`)
   - Pattern extraction
   - Best practice identification
   - Model versioning

### Key Features
- ⚠️ Community API submission (partial)
- ⚠️ API validation framework (partial)
- ⚠️ Pattern extraction (partial)
- ❌ Reputation system (not started)
- ❌ Quality scoring (not started)
- ❌ Automated testing (not started)

### Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3, Java 21
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Validation**: Custom validation engine
- **ML**: Pattern recognition algorithms

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/crowdsource/submit` - Submit API pattern
- `GET /api/crowdsource/patterns` - Retrieve validated patterns
- `POST /api/crowdsource/vote` - Vote on API quality
