# SupremeAI — GitHub Spec Kit Full Implementation Plan

**Repository:** `SaifulHaqueNiloy/supremeai`

**Goal:** Adopt GitHub Spec Kit as a lightweight, reviewable, agent-facing software-development governance layer for the existing SupremeAI codebase without replacing the application architecture or production runtime.

---

## 1. Executive Decision

**Adopt Spec Kit, but do NOT treat it as a production dependency.**

Spec Kit is a development/process layer for Spec-Driven Development (SDD), not an application runtime component. The current Spec Kit workflow is:

```text
constitution
→ specify
→ clarify
→ plan
→ checklist
→ tasks
→ analyze
→ implement
→ converge
```

GitHub explicitly supports adopting Spec Kit in an existing project in place, recommends creating a reviewable baseline first, and says the existing application does not need to be reconstructed into specifications before adoption. citeturn694845search0turn694845search8

### SupremeAI decision

```text
SupremeAI Runtime
    ├── FastAPI
    ├── React/Vite
    ├── PostgreSQL/pgvector
    ├── Redis (optional/deployment-dependent)
    ├── AI providers
    ├── HITL
    ├── automation/integration layers
    └── other existing services

SupremeAI Engineering Governance
    └── GitHub Spec Kit
```

Spec Kit should not add a new backend service, database, queue, API endpoint, or Render service.

---

# 2. Current Codebase Alignment

The current repository already has meaningful engineering governance and agent context:

- `AGENTS.md` defines agent behavior, autonomy-with-oversight, transparency, safety, context awareness, graceful degradation, memory, tools, and HITL rules. fileciteturn124file0
- `README.md` documents SupremeAI as a production-grade AI-agent platform with HITL, pgvector memory, OpenTelemetry, RBAC, audit logging, circuit breakers, rate limiting, and free-tier-oriented deployment. fileciteturn125file0
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` already defines branch-based development workflow, coding/testing/documentation guidance, and PR process. fileciteturn126file0

Therefore the Spec Kit adoption must **compose with these files**, not duplicate or override them.

---

# 3. What Spec Kit Adds

The largest missing capability in the current engineering process is a consistent traceable chain from:

```text
Requirement
    ↓
Design decision
    ↓
Implementation task
    ↓
Code change
    ↓
Verification
```

Spec Kit provides that loop and, importantly for a mature codebase, `/speckit.analyze` is designed to detect conflicts/gaps across `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md`, while `/speckit.converge` checks the current code against those artifacts and appends remaining work as traceable tasks. citeturn694845search6turn694845search1turn694845search4

---

# 4. Brownfield Adoption Rule

Do **not** attempt to generate a specification for the entire existing SupremeAI application.

GitHub's existing-project guidance recommends starting from a reviewable baseline and choosing a bounded first change; the new `spec.md` should define the intended new change rather than become a retroactive specification of the whole system. citeturn694845search0

### Required principle

```text
Existing system
    ↓
Existing docs + AGENTS + code + CI
    ↓
Spec Kit adoption
    ↓
Future bounded changes use SDD
```

Not:

```text
Existing system
    ↓
rewrite all architecture into specs first
```

---

# 5. Step 0 — Reviewable Baseline

Before initializing Spec Kit:

- [ ] Ensure working tree is clean, or use a dedicated adoption branch.
- [ ] Record current commit SHA.
- [ ] Make sure all current work is committed/stashed.
- [ ] Record current CI status.
- [ ] Record current tests/build status.
- [ ] Do not mix unrelated production fixes with Spec Kit bootstrap.

GitHub recommends a reviewable baseline before `specify init --here --force --integration <key>` for existing projects. citeturn694845search0

---

# 6. Step 1 — Initialize Spec Kit in Place

Run from repository root using the installed `specify` CLI:

```text
specify init --here --force --integration <chosen-agent>
```

Or use the documented installation flow and then initialize the current directory. GitHub documents `specify init .` / `specify init --here` and supports non-interactive operation for CI/agent environments. citeturn122file0turn694845search0

### Important

Before accepting initialization changes:

- [ ] Review every generated file.
- [ ] Confirm there are no destructive changes outside `.specify/` and selected integration files.
- [ ] Check whether existing files would be replaced.
- [ ] Preserve `AGENTS.md`.
- [ ] Preserve `README.md`.
- [ ] Preserve `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- [ ] Preserve current application docs.
- [ ] Preserve current CI/security policy.

---

# 7. Step 2 — Establish SupremeAI Constitution

Create the Spec Kit constitution from **existing documented project rules and explicit architecture decisions**, not from generic ideals.

GitHub specifically recommends using README, architecture decisions, contribution guide and CI as evidence when writing the constitution, and warns against inventing standards merely to fill the template. citeturn694845search0

## Proposed SupremeAI principles

### Principle I — Core Independence

SupremeAI Core MUST remain independent from optional third-party providers.

### Principle II — Security & HITL

Authentication, authorization, tenant isolation, auditability and HITL MUST NOT be bypassed by feature implementations or external integrations.

### Principle III — Graceful Degradation

Optional provider/integration failure MUST NOT unnecessarily break core AI functionality.

### Principle IV — Dynamic Production Configuration

Production deployment identity, endpoints, secrets and service selection MUST come from environment/secret-management configuration rather than hardcoded application values.

### Principle V — User-Local AI Is Optional

User-local Ollama MUST remain an optional user capability and MUST NOT become a backend availability dependency.

### Principle VI — Existing Architecture First

A new dependency/component MUST solve a verified gap and MUST NOT duplicate an existing capability without an evidence-based decision.

### Principle VII — Multi-Tenant Safety

Changes handling customer/user data MUST preserve tenant/user isolation and authorization boundaries.

### Principle VIII — Verification Before Completion

Tests, security checks, contract checks and convergence review are part of implementation, not optional follow-up work.

### Principle IX — Vendor Exit Path

External integrations SHOULD be isolated behind project-owned interfaces/adapters and remain replaceable.

### Principle X — Resource Awareness

Implementations MUST respect the current free-tier resource constraints and avoid unnecessary process, cache or service multiplication.

---

# 8. Constitution vs `AGENTS.md`

Do not create competing rule systems.

Recommended relationship:

```text
AGENTS.md
    ↓
Agent behavior / operating instructions

Spec Kit Constitution
    ↓
Project-level engineering principles for SDD
```

The same fundamental principles may appear in both, but they should not contradict each other.

Create a cross-reference section in `AGENTS.md`:

```text
For feature development using Spec-Driven Development,
see the active Spec Kit constitution and feature artifacts.
```

Do not make `AGENTS.md` a generated file.

---

# 9. Step 3 — Establish Directory Structure

Preferred brownfield structure:

```text
.
├── .specify/
│   ├── memory/
│   │   └── constitution.md
│   ├── templates/
│   ├── scripts/
│   ├── feature.json
│   └── ...
│
├── specs/
│   ├── 001-feature-name/
│   │   ├── spec.md
│   │   ├── plan.md
│   │   ├── tasks.md
│   │   ├── checklist.md
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
│
├── docs/
│   ├── architecture/
│   ├── deployment/
│   └── operations/
│
├── AGENTS.md
├── README.md
└── ...
```

Use the actual paths produced by the currently installed Spec Kit version rather than manually guessing file names. Spec Kit tracks the active feature via `.specify/feature.json` and resolves commands from that state rather than assuming the Git branch is the feature state. fileciteturn122file0

---

# 10. Existing Planning Documents — Migration Strategy

Do not delete current SupremeAI planning documents during bootstrap.

Classify each existing document as:

```text
A = global architecture / policy
B = active feature specification
C = implementation plan
D = operational runbook
E = historical plan
F = obsolete
```

### Mapping

```text
Global engineering principles
    → Constitution / architecture docs

Feature requirements
    → spec.md

Technical design
    → plan.md

Implementation units
    → tasks.md

Requirement-quality review
    → checklist

Completed feature history
    → feature directory archive/history

Operational procedures
    → docs/operations
```

Do not mechanically convert every old markdown file into a feature.

---

# 11. Step 4 — Choose the First Feature

The first Spec Kit feature should be bounded and valuable enough to prove the process.

Recommended first candidate:

```text
Production Configuration & Dynamic Endpoint Hardening
```

Why:

- It is already an active architectural concern.
- It crosses frontend, backend and deployment boundaries.
- It benefits from explicit requirements.
- It has measurable acceptance criteria.
- It is safer than attempting a major AI-runtime rewrite.

Alternative:

```text
Free-Tier Memory Crisis Remediation
```

Both are appropriate because the current project already has plans for them.

---

# 12. Step 5 — `/speckit.specify`

Feature specifications should describe **what and why**, not implementation details.

Example:

```text
/speckit.specify
Make SupremeAI production configuration deployment-agnostic.
Users and admins must be able to use the correct backend without
hardcoded deployment URLs in application source. Optional provider
configuration must remain optional, required configuration must fail
fast, and changing backend services must be possible through deployment
configuration without changing application code.
```

The current Spec Kit guidance explicitly separates specification from technical planning. fileciteturn122file0

---

# 13. Required Spec Content

Every serious SupremeAI feature spec should include:

- [ ] User stories.
- [ ] Functional requirements with stable IDs.
- [ ] Acceptance scenarios.
- [ ] Security constraints.
- [ ] Tenant/isolation requirements where relevant.
- [ ] Performance/resource constraints.
- [ ] Error/failure behavior.
- [ ] Configuration behavior.
- [ ] Backward compatibility constraints.
- [ ] Success criteria.
- [ ] Edge cases.

Avoid putting concrete library decisions into the specification unless the requirement itself depends on them.

---

# 14. Step 6 — `/speckit.clarify`

Use clarification before planning whenever requirements are ambiguous.

For SupremeAI, specifically ask about:

```text
Who is affected?
What is optional?
What must fail fast?
What must gracefully degrade?
What data may leave the system?
What is customer/tenant scoped?
What is user-local?
What must remain backward compatible?
What happens when the external dependency is down?
```

This is especially important for:

- billing
- auth
- HITL
- provider routing
- storage
- local Ollama
- third-party integrations
- deployment configuration

GitHub recommends `clarify` before planning to resolve underspecified behavior. citeturn122file0

---

# 15. Step 7 — `/speckit.checklist`

Use the checklist as **requirements quality validation**, not implementation status.

Spec Kit explicitly distinguishes custom checklist review from implementation completion. fileciteturn122file0

Example checklist for SupremeAI:

```text
[ ] Can each requirement be objectively tested?
[ ] Are optional dependencies clearly distinguished from required ones?
[ ] Is the tenant/security boundary explicit?
[ ] Is failure behavior defined?
[ ] Is backward compatibility explicit?
[ ] Is configuration ownership clear?
[ ] Is user-local functionality clearly separated from backend infrastructure?
```

---

# 16. Step 8 — `/speckit.plan`

This is where the existing SupremeAI architecture enters the process.

The plan MUST explicitly inspect and reuse:

```text
FastAPI
React/Vite
PostgreSQL/pgvector
existing Redis abstractions
existing provider interfaces
HITL
current auth/RBAC
storage abstractions
messaging abstractions
automation/n8n abstractions
OpenTelemetry
existing CI/CD
Infisical/environment configuration
```

Do not introduce a new architecture simply because the Spec Kit template mentions a preferred pattern.

---

# 17. Step 9 — `/speckit.tasks`

Tasks should be dependency ordered and implementation-sized.

Recommended task format:

```text
T001 [P0] Audit existing endpoint sources
T002 [P0] Define canonical configuration contract
T003 [P0] Remove production hardcoded fallback
T004 [P0] Add validation
T005 [P1] Update frontend build path
T006 [P1] Add regression tests
T007 [P1] Run staging verification
```

Every task should identify relevant:

- source files
- tests
- migration requirements
- security implications
- dependencies

---

# 18. Step 10 — `/speckit.analyze`

Before implementation:

```text
spec.md
   ↕
plan.md
   ↕
tasks.md
```

Run `/speckit.analyze` and require the agent to resolve:

- contradictions
- missing requirements
- duplicated tasks
- unsupported architecture decisions
- requirements not represented in tasks
- tasks not traceable to requirements

Spec Kit describes `analyze` as read-only and intended to detect inconsistencies before implementation. citeturn694845search6

---

# 19. Step 11 — `/speckit.implement`

The coding agent executes the task list.

For SupremeAI, implementation must additionally enforce existing `AGENTS.md` rules:

```text
security first
HITL for sensitive actions
auditability
graceful degradation
no data loss
no cross-tenant access
no unnecessary vendor lock-in
```

The agent should review both code and generated feature artifacts together.

---

# 20. Step 12 — `/speckit.converge`

This should become a mandatory final quality gate for major production changes.

Current Spec Kit `converge` reads `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md` against the present code, identifies gaps, and appends traceable remediation tasks without modifying application code itself. citeturn694845search1turn694845search4

Target loop:

```text
implement
   ↓
converge
   ↓
remaining tasks?
   ├── YES → implement → converge
   └── NO  → ready for review
```

---

# 21. Short vs Full SDD Path

Use the short path for small low-risk changes:

```text
specify
→ plan
→ tasks
→ implement
→ converge
```

Use the full path for production/architectural changes:

```text
constitution
→ specify
→ clarify
→ plan
→ checklist
→ tasks
→ analyze
→ implement
→ converge
```

This matches the current Spec Kit guidance. fileciteturn122file0turn694845search8

---

# 22. CI Integration — Do Not Run Every Spec Kit Command on Every PR

Spec Kit should not make CI unnecessarily expensive.

Recommended CI responsibilities:

```text
Every PR
  ├── standard tests/lint/typecheck/build
  ├── existing security checks
  ├── OpenAPI validation
  └── optional artifact consistency checks

Major feature PR
  ├── spec artifact present
  ├── plan/tasks present
  ├── analyze report reviewed
  └── converge completed before merge
```

Do not force full SDD for a typo or trivial dependency/comment change.

---

# 23. Feature Classification Policy

Add a lightweight classification rule.

## Class A — Tiny

Examples:

```text
copy change
small CSS fix
simple typo
```

Use normal PR process.

## Class B — Bounded Feature

Examples:

```text
new UI module
new API endpoint
provider adapter
storage feature
```

Use:

```text
specify → plan → tasks → implement → converge
```

## Class C — Production/Architecture

Examples:

```text
multi-tenancy
billing
auth/RBAC changes
new third-party platform
database architecture
deployment architecture
major memory/reliability work
```

Use full SDD.

---

# 24. Agent Prompt / Operating Rule

Add this to the project's AI-agent guidance:

```text
Before implementing a Class B or Class C feature, determine whether
there is an active Spec Kit feature specification. If none exists,
create one through the approved Spec Kit workflow. Do not implement
major behavior directly from a loose request when the change affects
security, data, architecture, deployment, billing, tenancy, or external
integrations.
```

Do not force an interactive command inside unattended CI; Spec Kit documents non-interactive operation for agent/CI environments. fileciteturn122file0

---

# 25. Spec Artifact Naming / Traceability

Each feature should have a stable ID:

```text
001-dynamic-production-config
002-memory-crisis-remediation
003-admin-dashboard-upgrade
004-local-ollama-provider
```

Use that ID in:

- feature directory
- branch name if the team chooses the optional git extension
- PR title/description
- commit references where useful
- task references

Note: current Spec Kit tracks the active feature through `.specify/feature.json`, not merely Git branch selection. fileciteturn122file0

---

# 26. Git Strategy

Current `CONTRIBUTING.md` already uses feature branches and PRs. fileciteturn126file0

Keep that behavior.

Spec Kit's optional git extension can be considered later, but it is not required for adoption. GitHub explicitly notes that Git integration is optional. citeturn694845search0

Preferred current strategy:

```text
feature/fix branch
      ↓
Spec artifacts
      ↓
Code
      ↓
Tests
      ↓
PR
      ↓
CI
      ↓
Review
      ↓
merge
```

---

# 27. Existing Documentation Governance

Define ownership:

| Artifact | Primary purpose | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | AI-agent operating behavior | Agent behavior |
| `.specify/memory/constitution.md` | SDD engineering principles | Feature planning constraints |
| `spec.md` | Feature WHAT/WHY | Feature requirements |
| `plan.md` | Feature HOW | Technical design |
| `tasks.md` | Work breakdown | Implementation sequence |
| `checklist.md` | Requirement-quality review | Reviewer |
| `docs/architecture/*` | Persistent architecture | Architecture record |
| `docs/operations/*` | Runbooks | Operations |
| `README.md` | Public/project overview | Project documentation |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contribution process | Contributor governance |

Avoid duplicate sources of truth.

---

# 28. Spec Persistence Decision

For SupremeAI, prefer **Flow-Forward / Historical Feature Records** for major features.

That means:

```text
feature 001
   ↓
implemented
   ↓
feature directory retained
   ↓
feature 002 created for future major change
```

GitHub's current guidance describes flow-forward as preserving each feature directory as a historical record, while living specs instead revise an existing `spec.md` and regenerate downstream artifacts. citeturn694845search2

Why Flow-Forward fits SupremeAI:

- auditable architectural evolution
- easier AI context reconstruction
- easier post-incident review
- no rewriting of historical intent
- clear relationship between feature and implementation

Living specs can still be used for genuinely long-lived product contracts where the team explicitly chooses that model.

---

# 29. Brownfield Architecture Discovery

Do not make architecture-discovery output part of every feature by default.

For the first adoption phase, use existing:

```text
README
AGENTS.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
docs/
CI workflows
source code
```

as context.

If a future major initiative requires architecture mapping, make that a dedicated bounded feature or assessment workstream.

Spec Kit also has an optional `assess` extension for idea/discovery work before the normal SDD flow; use it only when idea selection is actually needed. citeturn694845search7

---

# 30. Quality Gates for SupremeAI

For Class C changes, require this gate chain:

```text
[1] Constitution check
       ↓
[2] Specification
       ↓
[3] Clarification
       ↓
[4] Requirement checklist
       ↓
[5] Architecture plan
       ↓
[6] Tasks
       ↓
[7] Analyze
       ↓
[8] Implementation
       ↓
[9] Tests/security/CI
       ↓
[10] Converge
       ↓
[11] Human review
       ↓
[12] Merge/deploy
```

---

# 31. Security Rules for Spec Kit Artifacts

Spec files are repository artifacts and may contain sensitive architecture information.

Do not store:

- API keys
- secrets
- passwords
- private credentials
- actual production tokens
- Infisical secret values

References are acceptable:

```text
Use N8N_BASE_URL from deployment configuration.
```

Not:

```text
N8N_BASE_URL=https://...real-secret-value...
```

---

# 32. Dynamic-Configuration Compatibility

Spec Kit adoption must reinforce the current SupremeAI rule:

```text
Change service
   ↓
change environment / Infisical
   ↓
rebuild/redeploy
   ↓
same application source
```

A feature plan should explicitly identify whether new configuration is:

```text
required
optional
conditional
secret
public
runtime
build-time
```

This prevents future agents from introducing hardcoded deployment values.

---

# 33. Multi-Tenant Compatibility

Every feature spec involving customer data should explicitly answer:

```text
Tenant scope?
User scope?
Resource owner?
Shared resource?
Cross-tenant access allowed?
Cache key scope?
Storage key scope?
Audit scope?
Telemetry scope?
```

No feature should reach implementation without these questions when the feature touches customer data.

---

# 34. AI/LLM Feature Compatibility

Every AI feature should document:

```text
model requirements
optional provider requirements
fallback behavior
token/resource limits
privacy mode
tool permissions
HITL requirements
observability policy
```

Especially:

```text
missing optional provider key
    → NOT_CONFIGURED
```

not:

```text
system failure
```

This preserves the provider-optional architecture already present in SupremeAI.

---

# 35. Ollama Feature Compatibility

If a feature uses local Ollama, its spec MUST declare:

```text
Ollama is optional.
Backend works without it.
Local execution is user-controlled.
Cloud fallback behavior is defined.
Private local content does not automatically leave device.
```

The Spec Kit workflow should make these constraints explicit before implementation.

---

# 36. CI Enforcement — Initial Version

Do not build a giant “spec police” system immediately.

Phase 1 CI should only verify:

```text
feature metadata valid
required artifacts exist for Class B/C changes
no secrets in spec artifacts
markdown/template structure valid
```

Phase 2 can add:

```text
requirements/task traceability
analyze artifact presence
converge evidence
```

Avoid requiring AI-generated semantic interpretation inside CI until the process has stabilized.

---

# 37. Spec Kit CLI Version Management

Because Spec Kit is a development tool, pin the version used by the team/CI.

Recommended:

```text
SPEC_KIT_VERSION=<approved version>
```

Use a controlled install method rather than silently pulling the latest version on every agent run.

Review Spec Kit updates before adopting breaking changes.

---

# 38. Dependency / Runtime Impact

Spec Kit should have **zero production runtime dependency impact**.

It should not be added to:

```text
backend/requirements.txt
frontend/package.json
production Docker runtime image
Render runtime service
```

unless a separate documented use case appears.

The CLI belongs to development/agent tooling.

---

# 39. Rollout Plan

## Phase 1 — Bootstrap

- [ ] Create reviewable branch.
- [ ] Install pinned Spec Kit CLI.
- [ ] Run `specify init` in-place.
- [ ] Review generated files.
- [ ] Create constitution.
- [ ] Cross-link `AGENTS.md`.
- [ ] Document artifact ownership.

## Phase 2 — Pilot

Choose one bounded feature:

```text
Dynamic Production Configuration
```

Run the full flow once:

```text
specify
clarify
checklist
plan
tasks
analyze
implement
converge
```

## Phase 3 — Operationalize

- [ ] Add Class A/B/C policy.
- [ ] Add contribution guidance.
- [ ] Add optional CI validation.
- [ ] Add feature naming convention.
- [ ] Train future AI agents through `AGENTS.md`.

## Phase 4 — Scale

- [ ] Apply to architecture/security changes.
- [ ] Apply to major integrations.
- [ ] Apply to billing/multi-tenancy changes.
- [ ] Add more CI enforcement only after measuring value.

---

# 40. Definition of Done

Spec Kit adoption is complete when:

```text
[ ] .specify/ is initialized and reviewed.
[ ] Constitution reflects actual SupremeAI principles.
[ ] AGENTS.md and constitution do not conflict.
[ ] Existing docs remain intact and have clear ownership.
[ ] A first bounded feature is implemented through the SDD flow.
[ ] analyze is run before implementation for major work.
[ ] converge is run after implementation.
[ ] Feature artifacts are preserved in a traceable location.
[ ] No production runtime dependency on Spec Kit exists.
[ ] No secrets exist in spec artifacts.
[ ] Major feature development has an explicit SDD policy.
[ ] Future AI agents know when to use Spec Kit.
```

---

# 41. Agent Safety Rules

Any AI coding agent working on SupremeAI must:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` before major work.
2. Read the applicable Spec Kit constitution before planning.
3. Reuse existing architecture before creating new subsystems.
4. Preserve existing security/HITL boundaries.
5. Preserve tenant isolation.
6. Preserve dynamic environment/Infisical configuration.
7. Never store secrets in specs/plans/tasks.
8. Never treat optional provider absence as a mandatory failure.
9. Never make user-local Ollama a backend dependency.
10. Run `analyze` before major implementation.
11. Run tests and security checks after implementation.
12. Run `converge` before declaring a Class C feature complete.
13. If convergence identifies gaps, implement the added tasks and converge again.
14. Do not delete historical feature artifacts.
15. Do not rewrite unrelated architecture while implementing a bounded feature.

---

# 42. Recommended First Spec Kit Feature

Use this as the pilot:

```text
001-dynamic-production-configuration
```

Scope:

```text
frontend backend endpoint configuration
Firebase generated config
CORS source of truth
production host configuration
Infisical/environment mapping
optional provider configuration semantics
artifact validation
service replacement verification
```

This feature should build on the dynamic-configuration work already underway rather than introducing a new platform.

# 44. Final Principle

> **Spec Kit should make SupremeAI development more deliberate, traceable and verifiable without making the runtime more complex.**

The project should gain:

```text
better requirements
better architecture decisions
better task traceability
better AI-agent discipline
better completion verification
```

without gaining:

```text
another runtime service
another production database
another deployment dependency
another vendor lock-in
```

**Adopt the process, not the runtime. Preserve the current architecture. Use Spec Kit to make future changes safer.**
