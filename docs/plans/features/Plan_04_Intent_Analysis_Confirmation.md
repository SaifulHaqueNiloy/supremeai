## Overview
Intelligent system for analyzing user intent from natural language requirements and implementing confirmation workflows to ensure accurate understanding before proceeding with application generation.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
1. **Intent Analyzer** (`src/main/java/com/supremeai/intent/IntentAnalyzer.java`)
   - Natural language processing for requirement analysis
   - Entity extraction and classification
   - Intent classification algorithms

2. **Confirmation Engine** (`src/main/java/com/supremeai/confirmation/ConfirmationEngine.java`)
   - Multi-step confirmation workflows
   - Visual requirement validation
   - User feedback integration

3. **Requirement Processor** (`src/main/java/com/supremeai/processor/RequirementProcessor.java`)
   - Requirement size classification
   - Complexity assessment
   - Generation feasibility analysis

### Key Features
- ✅ Natural language requirement parsing
- ✅ Intent classification (web, mobile, desktop, etc.)
- ✅ Entity extraction (features, platforms, databases)
- ✅ Multi-step confirmation workflow
- ✅ Visual requirement preview

### Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3, Java 21
- **NLP**: Custom processing algorithms
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/intent/analyze` - Analyze user intent
- `POST /api/confirm/validate` - Validate requirements
- `GET /api/confirm/preview` - Generate requirement preview
