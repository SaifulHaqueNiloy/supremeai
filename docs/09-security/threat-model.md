# 💀 Threat Model

This document outlines the security threats, vectors, and mitigation strategies for SupremeAI 2.0.

## 🚨 Threat Analysis & Mitigations

### 1. Malicious Third-Party Packages (npm, PyPI, Docker)
- **Threat Description:** Supply chain attacks via compromised or typosquatted libraries from public marketplaces.
- **Impact:** System compromise, data exfiltration, or backdoor access in production.
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Sandboxing:** All discovered marketplace tools/dependencies must be tested in an isolated container/sandbox first.
  - **Scanning:** Integrate automated dependency scans using tools like Snyk or Dependabot before installing or merging packages into the codebase.
  - **Pinning:** Always pin dependency versions to specific hashes or semantic versions.

### 2. Unauthorized API Access & Injection
- **Threat Description:** Malicious entities calling the `/github/*` or `/marketplace/*` endpoints.
- **Impact:** Abuse of resources, cost inflation, or unauthorized repository access.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) and JWT validation on all endpoints.
  - Rate limit requests per user.

### 3. Compromised Secrets / API Keys
- **Threat Description:** Hardcoded secrets in code repositories.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to cloud platforms or customer GitHub orgs.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Secret scanning pre-commit hooks.
  - Auto-rotation policies (e.g. 90-day rotation for email app passwords).

### 4. AI Pushes Untested/Buggy Code to Production
- **Threat Description:** AI agent writes broken/malicious code and deploys it straight to production.
- **Impact:** Live environment downtime, crashes, or security vulnerabilities introduced in production.
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Canary/Staging Isolation:** Restrict the AI agent to only write to the staging repository (`saifulhaqueniloy/supremeai`). No direct push permission to the production repository (`paykaribazaronline/supremeai`).
  - **CI/CD Validation Pipeline:** Require all commits to pass lint, test, build, and security scans in the staging environment before being dispatched to the main repo.
