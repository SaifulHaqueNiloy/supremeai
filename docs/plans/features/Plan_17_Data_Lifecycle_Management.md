## Overview
Comprehensive data lifecycle management system governing data from creation through archival and deletion, ensuring compliance, optimizing storage costs, and maintaining data quality across all system components.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
1. **Data Classifier** (`src/main/java/com/supremeai/lifecycle/DataClassifier.java`)
   - Data type identification
   - Sensitivity classification
   - Retention period assignment

2. **Lifecycle Manager** (`src/main/java/com/supremeai/lifecycle/LifecycleManager.java`)
   - Automated data transitions
   - Retention policy enforcement
   - Archival and deletion

3. **Data Quality Monitor** (`src/main/java/com/supremeai/quality/DataQualityMonitor.java`)
   - Data validation
   - Quality metrics tracking
   - Anomaly detection
