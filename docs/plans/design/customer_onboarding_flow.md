# Customer Onboarding Flow

**Status:** proposed  
**Scope:** End-user onboarding experience from first visit to first successful agent execution

---

## 1. Purpose

Guide new customers from signup to their first successful agent task in under 60 seconds, without requiring technical configuration, API key setup, or documentation reading.

---

## 2. Onboarding Stages

### Stage 1: Landing (0–10 seconds)

- Value proposition headline: "Describe what you want to build"
- Single input field: project name + description
- CTA: "Start Building" (no account required for demo)

### Stage 2: Mode 3 Auth (10–20 seconds)

- Email magic link or "Continue with Google"
- No password, no username creation
- Session token issued automatically

### Stage 3: First Project Creation (20–40 seconds)

- Auto-create default project from landing input
- Show project dashboard with one-click templates:
  - "Build a REST API"
  - "Scrape a Website"
  - "Automate a Workflow"

### Stage 4: First Agent Task (40–60 seconds)

- Pre-filled prompt based on selected template
- Real-time progress indicator
- Success state with shareable result link

---

## 3. Progressive Disclosure

| Stage | Visible UI | Technical Exposure |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Landing | Logo, headline, input, CTA | None |
| Auth | Provider buttons | None |
| Project | Dashboard, templates | None |
| Task Execution | Progress, result | Agent name only |
| Post-Onboarding | Full dashboard | Capabilities revealed gradually |

---

## 4. Fallback & Edge Cases

- **Slow network:** Show optimistic UI with background sync
- **Provider failure:** Graceful degradation with "Try again" and cached suggestions
- **Abandoned session:** Email recovery link with pre-filled context

---

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] New user completes first task in < 60 seconds (measured)
- [ ] Zero technical configuration required before first execution
- [ ] Onboarding completion rate > 80%
- [ ] No password fields in customer-facing onboarding flow

---

## 6. Out of Scope

- Admin onboarding (Layer 1 concern)
- Enterprise SSO setup (handled post-onboarding)
- Billing configuration (deferred to first paid action)
