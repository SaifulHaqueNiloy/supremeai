"""Core data model: Issue, Severity, Category, ScanResult.

The Issue dataclass is the single contract consumed by every detector, every
fixer, every reporter and every external caller (the Next.js dashboard, the
GitHub Action, SARIF output, etc.). Keeping it stable and self-describing is
what makes the tool reusable across projects and pipelines.
